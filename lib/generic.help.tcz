%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l<FEELING> <NAME> [= <PARAMETERS>]
        <FEELING> [<PARAMETERS>]%]%x

There are two types of "feeling" commands on %@%n:

%4%r%l*  %xFeeling commands which require a character's name ('%g%l<FEELING> <NAME> [= <PARAMETERS>]%x'), such as '%g%lmoose <NAME>%x', '%g%lhug <NAME>%x', etc. (These feeling commands are listed in '%g%l%<feelings%>%x' with a '%y%l*%x' to left of their name, and most of these can be given an optional second parameter, e.g:  '%g%lhug <NAME> = warmly%x', etc.

%4%y%l*  %xFeeling commands which can be typed without any parameters ('%g%l<FEELING> [<PARAMETERS>]%x'), such as '%g%lwave%x', '%g%lwibble%x', '%g%llaugh%x', '%g%lgiggle%x', etc. (Most of these can be given an optional parameter, e.g:  '%g%lwibble excessively%x', '%g%llaugh loudly%x', '%g%lgiggle happily%x', etc.)

The best way to find out how feeling commands work, is to try them out for yourself:  Have a look at '%g%l%<feelings%>%x' and then try out those which appeal to you.

%xEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

%PAGE

%h<CENTER>%h%c%l%{@?padcentre 0 " " "Preamble"}%h</CENTER>%h

%xThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

%PAGE
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: %m%l(1)%x copyright the software, and %m%l(2)%x offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.

%PAGE
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

%r%lThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.%x

%PAGE

%h<CENTER>%h%m%l%{@?padcentre 0 " " "GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE"}%h</CENTER>%h
%h<CENTER>%h%r%l%{@?padcentre 0 " " "TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION"}%h</CENTER>%h

%y%l%40. %xThis License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

   %4Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

%PAGE
%y%l%41. %xYou may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

   %4You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

%y%l%42. %xYou may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

%PAGE
%c%la) %4%xYou must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

%c%lb) %4%xYou must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

%c%lc) %4%xIf the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

%PAGE
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.

%PAGE
%y%l%43. %xYou may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

%c%la) %4%xAccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

%c%lb) %4%xAccompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

%c%lc) %4%xAccompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

%PAGE
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

%PAGE
%y%l%44. %xYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

%y%l%45. %xYou are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

%PAGE
%y%l%46. %xEach time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.

%y%l%47. %xIf, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

%PAGE
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

%PAGE
%y%l%48. %xIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

%y%l%49. %xThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

%PAGE

%xIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

   %y%l<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>

%xAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

%TITLE An introduction to %@%n Official Rules
The official rules are a detailed set of guidelines for %c%lALL%x users and administrators of %@%n, implemented and intended to maintain order amongst both its users and administrators.

These rules help keep %@%m a friendly and enjoyable environment for all of its users by helping keep it free from abusive and malicious people, and users who misuse privileges with which they have been entrusted (This includes Builders and administrators.)

As a user of %@%m, you are expected to thoroughly read, understand and abide by these rules at all times.  If you fail to do so, and break rules intentionally or unintentionally, you will receive appropriate punishment.  This will initially be in the form of a verbal warning and possible removal of abused privileges, but if you continue to ignore and break rules, you could be banned from %@%m completely.

%PAGE
Each rule may be preceeded by a rating (E.g:  '%m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>%x'.)  The number (On a scale of %y%l1%x (%g%lNot too serious%x) to %y%l5%x (%r%l%fVery serious%x)) indicates how serious breaking that particular rule will be treated.  The ratings are intended as a guideline, and will be used to help decide on suitable punishment when a rule is broken.

%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xIf a rule has a low rating, this does not mean that it is acceptable to purposely break it or ignore the fact that it has been broken.  If a rule is broken, suitable punishment must be issued promptly.

              %9%6These rules apply to the date at the top of the help page for '%g%l%<rules%>%x'.  The administrators of %@%m reserve the right to change, amend or add to these rules at any time without prior notice.  Any significant additions or amendments will be announced on %@%n BBS in the %y%lNEWS%x topic (See '%g%l%<bbs%>%x'.)

%TITLE Safety Guidelines for %w%l%u%fALL%x users of %@%m...
All users of %@%m should be aware that things that occur in real life, either if they are directly or indirectly linked to occurances on %@%m, that the administrators %r%l%ucannot%x be held responsible, nor can they punish or ban users without proof that abuse has actually occurred on %@%m.  We advise that all users of %@%m, in common with all other forms of anonymous Internet communication, should follow some basic safety guidelines:

%y%l%4*  %c%l%uNEVER%x give out your real life personal details (Home address, telephone number, etc) to anyone you do not know in real life  -  Even if you've known them 'virtually' for a long time, they may not be who you think they are.

%r%l%4*  %c%l%uNEVER%x forget that others may adopt 'Internet Personas' which may, or may not, correspond to their real life personas.  In other words, don't believe all you read!

%y%l%4*  %c%l%uREMEMBER%x, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

%PAGE
If something is happening in real life as a result of the occurances of not following the above guidelines, please note, we can only advise the following:

   %m%l%4Get in touch with the Police, or whatever other Authorities you can (Offender's Internet Provider(s), etc.) and pass on the information you know.  We can only act upon punishable offenses we see and have proof of on %@%m.

%9%4%r%lIMPORTANT:  %xThe administrators of %@%m will %y%l%u*NOT*%x see fit to punish possible users who use %c%l*NON* %@%m related incidents%x in order to cause or inflict spite or punishment of other possible users.  To punish a user requires solid proof that the user did do something wrong, and that proof needs to be visible to other administrators on %@%m's server.

%TITLE Guidelines for Acceptable Behaviour
The Administrators of %@%m must take a conservative view towards certain forms of language and behaviour in public locations such as %y%l%@%n BBS%x and the %y%lSwan Pub%x, regardless of their personal opinions about such things.

The %y%l%(CENSOR%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<censor flag%>%x') was incorporated into %@%m to protect both younger users and %@%m itself from any complaints made to its host (%c%l%@%l%x) and/or server administrators.

However, not all forms of slang/vulgarity are caught by the automatic bad language censor which is active in public locations, and the following guidelines are a companion to the auto-censor and guide for the user for acceptable language and behaviour in the public areas of %@%m.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Public Rooms
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xPublic discussions of a sexual nature must use proper, clinical terminology, in its correct context.  If you use vulgarities/slang at all in public areas (This includes attempts to get around the auto-censor by using different spellings or ASCII characters), you will be asked to stop or take it to a private room or chat channel.

Failure to comply with the Administrator's request will result in an Official Warning and/or further punishment.

%PAGE

%c%l%$The BBS (Bulletin Board System)
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xDue to the nature of some BBS topics, sexual discussions take place.  Their purpose is to inform and help users with sexual problems or questions.  This does not give license to use improper, vulgar terminology in these discussions.  You must use the proper, clinical terms in their correct context.

Any malicious BBS post done merely to provoke a slagging match, 'spam' (Excessive posting), or to attack another user, will be censored or removed depending on the content and the user will be warned to stop.

Any BBS post found to contain vulgar words and/or phrases (This also includes attempts to get around the auto-censor by using different spellings or ASCII characters) will be censored or removed by the Administrators, and if necessary an Official Warning will be given.

%PAGE
Failure to comply with this may result in the loss of your %y%l%(^flag BBS%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<bbs flag%>%x') and an entry on your rapsheet.


%c%l%$Final Words
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe Admin have no wish to inhibit the users of %@%m.  Certain forms of discussions are not being prohibited, we merely ask that if you are going to be in a public location, such as %y%lThe Swan Pub%x, you exercise caution when using terminology that might be considered offensive.

What you do or say in private rooms is your business and no Admin will ever interfere with that.  However, public areas such as the %y%lBBS%x or %y%lThe Swan Pub%x %r%l%uMUST BE KEPT CLEAN%x to protect younger users.

As an %rAssistant%x or %r%lExperienced Builder%x, the rules for both General Users (See '%g%l%<general rules%>%x') and Builders (See '%g%l%<builder rules%>%x') apply as well as the following...

%4%r%l*  %xThe %rAssistant%x and %r%lExperienced Builder%x ranks are %c%lNOT%x part of the administration team, and do not have any administrative rights or privileges (With the exception of the use of the '%g%l%(assist%)%x' and '%g%l%(welcome%)%x' commands (See '%g%l%<assist%>%x' and '%g%l%<welcome%>%x') when there are few or no Admin connected.)

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xAs an %rAssistant%x, you must be prepared to help any users who ask you for it.  If you are unable to help them, you should direct them to either a member of Admin or another %rAssistant/%r%lExperienced Builder%x who can.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %xProviding help and assistance is a requirement of the %rAssistant%x rank, but optional for %r%lExperienced Builders%x, who are given the rank as recognition for their building skills and to help them to improve and extend their skills further.  However, %r%lExperienced Builders%x must not outrightly refuse to give help and assistance  -  If you do not wish to help the user, you must redirect them to another %rAssistant%x, %r%lExperienced Builder%x or member of Admin who can.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xIf there are only a few members of Admin connected, or no Admin connected at all, you should use the '%g%l%(assist%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<assist%>%x') to check for and provide assistance to users who require it, and welcome new users.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %r%lExperienced Builders%x must not use their extra privileges to hack or obtain privileges to which they are not entitled.  %r%lExperienced Builder%x privileges are entrusted to the users to whom they are given.  Any abuse of these extra privileges will result in removal of %r%lExperienced Builder%x status.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xAs an %r%lExperienced Builder%x or %rAssistant%x, you must behave reasonably and responsibly at all times.

Although giving help and assistance is not a requirement of the %r%lExperienced Builder%x status (It is a requirement of the %rAssistant%x status, however), you must not outrightly refuse or be offensive to the user asking.  If you do not wish to help them or are unable to, please refer them to another %rAssistant%x, %r%lExperienced Builder%x or administrator.

%TITLE Rules for %w%ladministrators%x
As an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above, it's important that you act responsibly and fairly at all times, and give help and assistance to users as and when they need it to the best of your ability.  It's important that you bear in mind that anything you do or say in public reflects not only on yourself, but the entire Admin team and %@%m as a whole, both of which you are a part of and representing.

These rules are designed as basic guidelines to what you should and shouldn't do as an administrator, and must be followed at all times.  Violating the rules will result in appropriate punishment and official warnings being issued.  Failure to comply with the rules after official warnings have been issued could ultimately result in your demotion.

%c%l%$General rules for administators...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xDo not do anything which could degrade the credibility of %@%m, its Admin team, or the provider of its Internet connection (%y%l%@%l%x.)

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xDo not harass any user, or do anything which may cause users to leave %@%m, and use another MUD instead.  If there are personal problems with a certain user, then avoid contact with them.  If necessary, use the friend flags to block all messages from them.  Type '%g%l%(fadd%) <NAME>%x' and '%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = enemy !fchat !link !mail !pagetell !pagetellfriends%x' (See '%g%l%<fadd%>%x' and '%g%l%<fset%>%x'.)

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xDo not connect to %@%m if you are depressed, drunk, or otherwise likely to act irresponsibly and abuse your powers.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xDo not advertise any other MUD which can be accessed via the Internet, on a public channel, via %@%m internal mail or in a title/description.  This includes saying the address in a room.  You can give out the address of another MUD over a private channel to another user (Providing they have asked you for it), e.g:  Via '%g%l%(page%)%x', '%g%l%(tell%)%x' or '%g%l%(mail%)%x' (See '%g%l%<page%>%x', '%g%l%<tell%>%x' and '%g%l%<mail%>%x'.)

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xDo not act irresponsibly elsewhere on the Internet, where you can be recognised as a member of the %@%m Admin team.  This means do not go to other MUD's and be abusive, or advertise %@%m on them.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xDo not 'hack' to obtain privileges higher than your level.  If you need a certain privilege, ask someone of a higher level than you to help you with it.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xDo not boot a dead connection unless it's absolutely necessary  -  The '%g%l%(@bootdead%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@bootdead%>%x') can be used by a user to boot any dead connections they might have.  Connections that are 'stuck' can also be revived by logging in again and taking them over.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xMortal users are only allowed a maximum of %c%lONE%x puppet, providing the need for it can be fully justified.  Temporary puppets can be obtained by Mortals from the %c%lPuppet Bank%x (This can be reached by typing '%g%lpuppet%x'.)  The use of a permanent puppet in a building project as a shopkeeper (For example) is not a suitable use.  A suitably named object would give the desired effect.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Rules for dealing with other users...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xAnswer all assists and welcomes when you can (See '%g%l%<assist%>%x' and '%g%l%<welcome%>%x'), especially if there are few Admin connected, or you are the only member of Admin connected.  If there is a sufficient number of Admin connected, try to take it in turns to do them.  New Admin have priority over assists and welcomes.  Remember that higher ranking members of Admin may not see assist/welcome messages if a sufficient number of lower ranking Admin are connected.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xIf a user asks you for help, help them to the best of your ability  -  This is a priority over building or chatting to your friends.  If you are not able to help them, ask someone who can.  It's important to stay and see what the answer to the problem is, and to try and learn from it.

%c%l%$Rules for dealing with abusive/problem users...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xIf a user is abusive to you or other users  -  Deal with them appropriately.  The order of punishment is as follows:

%9%9%8   %y%lAn official warning:  %x'%g%l%(warn%) <NAME> = <REASON>%x'.
%9%9%8                         (See '%g%l%<warn%>%x.)  Official warnings are logged to the '%c%lWarn%x' log file (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'.)

%9%9%8   %y%lThe Punishment Zone:  %x'%g%lpunish <NAME> = <REASON>%x'.
%9%9%8                         They will be broken off from all contact with other users, and have to type out some of %@%m's rules, before getting out.  (Use '%g%lunpunish <NAME> = <REASON>%x' to let them out prematurely.)

%PAGE
%9%9%8   %y%lJail:                 %x'%g%ljail <NAME> = <REASON>%x'.
%9%9%8                         They will be unable to leave the jail.  Admin can get out by typing '%g%ldoor%x' or '%g%l%(escape%)%x'.  (Use '%g%lfree <NAME> = <REASON>%x' to let them out.)

%9%9%8   %y%lMoron:                %x'%g%l%(@set%) *<NAME> = moron = <REASON>%x'.
%9%9%8                         (See '%g%l%<moron flag%>%x.)  They will then have negative privileges.  They will be unable to page people (Except Admin), use %@%m mail, or whisper secretly.  (Use '%g%l%(@set%) *<NAME> = !moron = <REASON>%x' to reset the moron flag.)

%PAGE
%9%9%8   %y%lBoot:                 %x'%g%l%(@boot%) *<NAME> = <REASON> [= <BAN TIME>]%x'.
%9%9%8                         (See '%g%l%<@boot%>%x'.)  They will be booted (Forcefully disconnected) from %@%m, and a public message will be displayed showing the boot and the reason.  It's also logged to the '%c%lBoot%x' log file (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'.)  %y%l<BAN TIME>%x is an optional time in minutes (Up to %c%l60 minutes%x) to ban the user, so that they can't reconnect again almost immediately.

%9%9%8   %y%lBan:                  %x'%g%l%(@ban%) *<NAME> = <TIME>|permanently = <REASON>%x'.
%9%9%8                         (See '%g%l%<@ban%>%x'.)  Bans the user for the time specified or permanently.  Users can only be banned by %c%lWizard/%cDruids%x and above.  If you're an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x and can't set a necessary ban, ask a higher level character to do so for you.  (Use '%g%l%(@ban%) *<NAME> = lift = <REASON>%x' to lift a ban.)  Be sure to send E-mail to the banned user explaining why they have been banned.

%PAGE
%9%9%y%l*  %c%lSite bans%x  -  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xIf a user keeps creating new duplicate characters and/or Guest characters, then a site ban may be necessary.

%9%9%3                 %y%l*  %xTo ban a site from creating characters, use:
%9%9%3                    '%g%l%(@site set%) <ADDRESS> = !create = <REASON>%x' (See '%g%l%<@site set%>%x'.)
%9%9%3                 %r%l*  %xLikewise, to stop Guest character being created from a site, use:
%9%9%3                    '%g%l%(@site set%) <ADDRESS> = !guest = <REASON>%x'.
%9%9%3                 %y%l*  %xThe flags can be combined:
%9%9%3                    '%g%l%(@site set%) <ADDRESS> = !create !guest = <REASON>%x'.

%9%9                 If you set a site to be create or guest banned, you should re-describe it to reflect that  -  Use '%g%l%(@site desc%) <IP ADDRESS> = <DESCRIPTION>%x' (See '%g%l%<@site desc%>%x'.)  Add '%y%l(Create Banned)%x', '%y%l(Guest Banned)%x', or '%y%l(Create and Guest Banned)%x' to the end of the site's description.

%PAGE
%9%9%1%r%l*  %c%lMail abuse%x  -  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xIf a user is abusing the internal mail system, reset their %y%l%(MAIL%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<mail flag%>%x') using '%g%l%(@set%) *<NAME> = !mail = <REASON>%x'.  This prevents them from sending or receiving any mail whatsoever.  If they're just harassing one particular user, get that user to add them as a friend (Or enemy), and type '%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = !mail%x' (See '%g%l%<fadd%>%x' and '%g%l%<fset%>%x'.)  This prevents them sending mail to that one person.

%9%9%1%y%l*  %c%lBBS abuse%x   -  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xIf someone continually abuses the BBS by posting rude, offensive or degrading messages, then reset their %y%l%(BBS%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<bbs flag%>%x') using '%g%l%(@set%) *<NAME> = !bbs = <REASON>%x'.

%9%9%1%r%l*  %c%lRap sheets%x  -  %m%l<<<%y%l2%m%l>>>  %xLog any abuse onto a user's rapsheet with the '%g%laddrap%x' command.  The usage is '%g%laddrap <NAME> = <ABUSE>%x'.  To see what they've done in the past, use '%g%lcheckrap <NAME>%x'.  This helps to identify consistent problem users.

%PAGE
%9%9%7%y%l*  %c%lMonitoring users%x  -  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xIf a user is suspected of hacking or abuse, and needs to be watched, use the '%g%l%(@monitor%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@monitor%>%x'.)  The basic use is '%g%l%(@monitor%) <NAME> = commands = <REASON>%x'.  Do not use '%g%l%(@monitor%)%x' unless it's strictly necessary, as it breaches on the user's privacy.  Use '%g%l%(@monitor%) <NAME> = off%x' to stop monitoring.


%c%l%$Rules for administrative privileges...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xUse the '%g%l%(shout%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<shout%>%x') only for important messages which %c%lALL%x users connected need to see.  '%g%l%(@with%) connected ...%x' (See '%g%l%<@with%>%x') in conjunction with '%g%l%(page%)%x', '%g%l%(tell%)%x' or '%g%l%(@notify%)%x' is treated as a '%g%l%(shout%)%x' (See '%g%l%<page%>%x', '%g%l%<tell%>%x' and '%g%l%<@notify%>%x'.)  Please remember that you are representing the Admin team as a whole, and every connected user will see your message.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xDo not use '%g%l%(page%)%x', '%g%l%(tell%)%x' or '%g%l%(@notify%)%x' in conjunction with '%g%l%(@with%) friends%x' or '%g%l%(@with%) connected%x' (See '%g%l%<@with%>%x') as an alternative or substitute for the '%g%l%(page%) friends%x', '%g%l%(tell%) friends%x' or '%g%l%(shout%)%x' command ('%g%l%<page%>%x', '%g%l%<tell%>%x' and '%g%l%<shout%>%x'.)  This rule is for two simple reasons...

   %9%g%l(1)  %xIt causes extra and unnecessary work for the server, especially if you have a large friends list or there are a good number of users connected.  '%g%l%(page%) friends%x', '%g%l%(tell%) friends%x' or '%g%l%(shout%)%x' will only take a few milliseconds to execute, whereas '%g%l%(@with%) friends%x' or '%g%l%(@with%) connected%x' can take up to several seconds, causing unnecessary 'lag'.

%PAGE
   %9%g%l(2)  %xIf '%g%l%(@notify%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@notify%>%x') is used with these commands, the recipients have no easy means of selectively blocking the messages if they do not wish to receive them.  With '%g%l%(page%) friends%x' and '%g%l%(tell%) friends%x' they can simply reset the %y%l%(^friend PAGETELLFRIENDS%)%x friend flag (See '%g%l%<pagetellfriends%>%x') on you if they do not wish to receive the messages.  If '%g%l%(page%)%x'/'%g%l%(tell%)%x' is used (I.e:  '%g%l%(@with%) friends me do %g%l%(tell%) $6 = hello%x'), this can be extremely confusing for the recipients, as to them it appears as though you have specifically and individually sent the message to them, rather than your entire list of friends.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xDo not give out your privileges to other characters, by giving out your password or giving them a compound command with your '%g%l%(@chpid%)%x' in it (See '%g%l%<@chpid%>%x'.)

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xDo not use your privileges for your own personal gain, benefit or pleasure.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xDo not use '%g%l%(@force%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@force%>%x') to force another character (Excluding your own puppets) to execute a command or say something against their will.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xDo not use fuses (See '%g%l%<@fuse%>%x') to monitor rooms or characters.  This is a serious breach of privacy.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xDo not destroy a character on user request under any circumstances.  If a character is left unused they will eventually be destroyed by the automatic maintainence system.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xDo destroy characters when they are found to be duplicates, but only if you are certain that they're duplicates.  Remember that some users will connect from the same account and might have the same E-mail address.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xBe very judicious in creating alarms, for your own or any other character's use.  Several alarms going off at the same time, or on a regular basis (I.e:  More than once every %c%l5 minutes%x) can cause unnecessary 'lag'.  The same effect can often be achieved using a fuse and the '%g%l{%(@?time%)}%x' query command (See '%g%l%<@?time%>%x'), and should always be done as an alternative, if possible.

   %4The ownership of an alarm should never be changed to a Mortal character.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xDo not use the '%g%l%(@areawrite%)%x', '%g%l%(@oecho%)%x' or '%g%l%(@write%)%x' commands (See '%g%l%<;%>%x', '%g%l%<@oecho%>%x' and '%g%l%<@write%>%x') in %y%l#2%x, %y%l#4%x, or a public area.  Likewise do not use these (And similar) commands (I.e:  '%g%l%(@notify%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@notify%>%x') to fake messages, or fake another user's actions or speech.

%PAGE
%COMMENT %4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xWhen adding Internet sites, use the rules for site adding as stated in the %y%lAPPRENTICES%x topic on %c%l%@%n BBS%x (See '%g%l%<bbs%>%x') or in the file '%y%ltczadmin.siteguidelines.txt%x', available from the FTP archive (See '%g%l%<ftp%>%x'.)
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xWhen adding Internet sites, use the rules for site adding as stated in the %y%lAPPRENTICES%x topic on %c%l%@%n BBS%x (See '%g%l%<bbs%>%x'.)

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xDo not set an execution time limit greater than %c%l3 seconds%x, unless it's absolutely necessary for the compound command to function.  In most cases (If not all), it will usually be possible to re-write the compound command more efficiently, so that it doesn't need an execution time limit greater than %c%l3 seconds%x.  An execution time limit greater than %c%l5 seconds%x should never be used, as this will cause noticable lag.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xDo not teleport a Mortal owned command to a module in %y%l#4%x (Or to %y%l#4%x itself), if it's not set %y%l%(READONLY%)%x (See '%g%l%<readonly flag%>%x'.)  If the %y%l%(READONLY%)%x flag stops the compound command working correctly, then it either needs to be re-written or Admin owned instead (A Mortal's compound command should never be changed to Admin ownership without first extensive checking for hacks, 'backdoors' or flaws which could be taken advantage of by Mortals.)

%PAGE
%4   An easy way to teleport commands into %y%l#4%x is to use the '%g%ltelglobal%x' command, which takes those rules into account.  Type '%g%ltelglobal <COMMAND>%x' to use it.  The '%g%lcheckmodule%x' command can be used to examine the modules in %y%l#4%x for any commands which breach the rules.  Any global commands also need to be coded efficiently, and use good grammar, spelling, and presentation.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xDo not disclose any information which is only readable/accessible by Admin to non-Admin users.  This includes the '%g%l%(natter%)%x' channel (See '%g%l%<natter%>%x'), restricted BBS topics (Such as the Admin only topics), contents of log files (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'), rap sheets, and any other information/commands which a lower level user couldn't access themselves.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xDo not destroy or modify objects which belong to other users (Both Mortal and Admin owned), unless you have the permission from the owner to do so (An exeception to this rule is if the object is being used to 'spam' users/areas, is abusive/offensive in some way, or is being used to lag/hack %@%m.)

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l3%m%l>>>  %xDo not adjust the bank account or credit in pocket of a user without good reason (I.e:  The user has obtained credit by unfair means or is in severe debt.)  This is important, because improper use of the '%g%l%(@credit%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@credit%>%x') command (I.e:  Injecting excessive money into the system or taking it out) could ruin the entire monetary system and make it worthless.


%c%l%$Rules for building and Building Quota limits...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l1%m%l>>>  %xTo obtain a %y%l%(BUILDER%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<builder flag%>%x'), a character must have a valid and unique E-mail address.  This ensures that they are not duplicates.  To see if anyone else on %@%m has the same E-mail address, use the '%g%lcheckb%x' command.  If so, enquire as to why their address is not unique.  To see if the address is valid and not fake, the easiest way is to send an E-mail to it, and get them to reply.  Do not set a %y%l%(BUILDER%)%x flag until you are sure that the E-mail address is valid and the character isn't a duplicate.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l2%m%l>>> %xDo not raise a characters Building Quota limit above %c%l500%x, unless they really need it, and they are building something of good quality that is beneficial to users of %@%m other than themselves and just a few friends.  This is %r%lIMPORTANT%x  -  'Good quality' means good, well written descriptions, fields of exits are set ('%g%l%(@osucc%)%x', '%g%l%(@odrop%)%x' and '%g%l%(@drop%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@osucc%>%x', '%g%l%<@odrop%>%x' and '%g%l%<@drop%>%x'), compound commands are well used and written, no objects are used that could be placed in a description instead.  Be very stringent about giving out Building Quota limits greater than %c%l500%x.  It's irrelevant that many other users may already have more than 500  -  That's the limit for Builders unless they are building something exceptional.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Rules for promotions and demotions...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xDo not promote a character to %rAssistant%x, %r%lExperienced Builder%x or %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or higher.  Promotions are carried out when there is an Admin review (Or for %r%lExperienced Builders%x and %rAssistants%x, as the result of a vote in favour between all administrators on %@%n BBS.)  The exception to this is promoting your puppet to %r%lExperienced Builder%x or %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x, if you are able.  If you're an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x yourself, you can still have your puppet promoted to the same level  -  Just ask someone of a higher level to do it for you.

   %4%rAssistants%x and %r%lExperienced Builders%x may be promoted after a votable message on %@%n BBS gives them a %c%l60%%%x or more majority in favour.  The message must be on the BBS for at least a week before a promotion is given, and the voting must use the majority factor ('%g%lvote <NUMBER> = majority%x'  -  See '%g%l%<majority factor%>%x'.)

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xOnly users who are of %c%l16%x years of age or over may be promoted to the rank of %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above.  This is because material Admin may be subject to and situations they may need to deal with are unsuitable for users below this age.  If a member of Admin is discovered at a later date to be under the age of 16, they will be immediately demoted.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xAdministrators on %@%m may not be administrators on any other MUD.  The main reason for this rule is that someone who is Admin on more than one MUD will not be able to be fully dedicated to administrating %@%m, to which they should be fully dedicated.  It's also unfair on other people who are not administrators on any MUD, who's chances are reduced by people who are administrators on more than one MUD.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xAdministrators must be able to connect on a regular basis, as one of their primary tasks is giving help and assistance to both existing and new users and dealing with abusive/problem users.  Of course, allowances are made for holidays and other periods where a member of Admin will be away for a short period of time.  If you are going to be away for a period of time, you must announce when and how long you will be away in the %y%lADMIN/ABSENCES%x topic of %@%n BBS.  If you fail to do this, your demotion may occur.

   %4A member of Admin should ideally connect for %c%l24 hours%x or more each month.  If a member's connect time is considered insufficient in a period of %c%l3%x consecutive months, their status will be subject to review.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l4%m%l>>>  %xThe returning of a flag (%r%lExperienced Builder/%rAssistant%x and above) should first go to an Admin vote, unless predefined by a time period elapsing (I.e:  Their flag was taken away for %c%lone week%x and %c%lone week%x has elapsed since its removal.)  The vote should be held in the BBS '%y%lAdmin/Voting%x' topic, where %c%lALL%x Admin may vote.

%4%r%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l2%m%l>>>  %xIf a member of Admin wishes to resign, then demote them, but be sure to remind them that they have a period of %c%l2 weeks%x in which to change their mind.  After this period has passed, they will need to go through the review process again to re-join the Admin team.  If an %r%lExperienced Builder%x or Builder abuses their building privileges, take their flag away.  If you are not sure about doing this, discuss it on the '%g%l%(natter%)%x' channel and have a vote if necessary.

%4%y%l*  %m%l<<<%y%l5%m%l>>>  %xIf a member of Admin starts maliciously abusing their power/privileges, and refuses to stop, everything within the power of the administrators connected at the time should be done to stop them, including demotion, if necessary.

%TITLE The history of %@%n

%c%l%$How it all began...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%y%lThe Chatting Zone%x (%y%lTCZ%x) all began as a dream I had to write the 'ultimate' MUD/talker system.  In those days, I was only a user/builder on a number of MUD's around at the time.  My aim was to design and develop a system of my own, which was not only user-friendly and easy to use, but also extremely flexible and powerful too.

On the %y%l21st December, 1993%x I downloaded the source to %c%lTinyMUD v1.5%x and began to turn it into the bare basics of TCZ.  At this time, I was studying at the %c%lUniversity of Greenwich%x in %c%lLondon%x, %c%lUK%x, and my Internet access was very limited (Home Internet access in the UK at that time was virtually non-existant.)

The game was ran locally on one of the servers at the university, where it picked up its first ever regular users (%y%lRatty%x, %y%lDiceman%x, %y%lThe Captain%x and %y%lUK1%x  -  Most of these users are still with us today.)

%PAGE
After the Christmas 1993 holidays, I obtained an early version of the %c%lUglyMUG%x source code (%c%l1990-1991 version%x)  -  Both this and the %c%lTinyMUD%x code (Which I was still working on) were both very primitive and unstable.  Over the next few weeks, I integrated the %c%lTinyMUD%x code and most of the features I had added to it into the %c%lUglyMUG%x code to produce the basics of %y%lTCZ v1.0%x (%c%l10th March 1994%x.)


%c%l%$TCZ goes 'live' at the University of Plymouth...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xTwo months of hard work and bug fixing saw the completion of %y%lTCZ v2.0%x (%c%l18th May 1994%x)  -  This version was just about functional enough for networked use  -  All I had to do was find an Internet site from where I could test and run it.  After a few weeks of searching, I was offered the opportunity to run it on a machine at the %c%lUniversity of Plymouth%x, where a student BBS system (Originally named '%c%lHades BBS%x', then later '%c%lFlux BBS%x') was presently operating.

%PAGE
I accepted the offer of a site and TCZ became available 'net-wide' for the first time ever near the end of %y%lMay 1994%x (%g%lzeus.sc.plym.ac.uk%x, port number %g%l8342%x.)  The main administrators of the game were me (%y%lJC Digita%x), %y%lWhoosh%x, %y%lCase%x and %y%lNemo%x (Whoosh, Case and Nemo were the administrators of '%c%lFlux BBS%x'.)

At this time, the game was very unstable (An up-time of 1 day was extremely rare) and had very few features.  Although we never had peaks of more than 10-15 users at that time, running the game 'net-wide' enabled many bugs which had evaded testing sessions to be tracked down and fixed, resulting in greater stability.

Plymouth TCZ saw the introduction of a simple town structure to the game.  This was fairly successful, but wasn't planned or organised  -  I saw the potential for a good town layout for the basis of the game, so I drew up a map on paper (Which I still have today) and started to develop this town on my own copy of TCZ, which was still running locally at the %c%lUniversity of Greenwich%x.

%PAGE
Near the end of %c%lJune 1994%x saw the completion of %y%lTCZ v2.2%x  -  In this version, ANSI %r%lc%g%lo%y%ll%b%lo%m%lu%c%lr%x was implemented, the connection interface was improved (So you were prompted to enter your name, password, etc. instead of having to type '%g%lconnect <NAME> <PASSWORD>%x' or '%g%lcreate <NAME> <PASSWORD>%x'), character names with spaces were allowed (Thanks to the new connect interface) and early versions of the '%g%l%(@if%)%x', '%g%l%(@for%)%x', '%g%l%(@with%)%x' and '%g%l%(@while%)%x' (Selection and interation) commands were implemented (See '%g%l%<@if%>%x', '%g%l%<@for%>%x', '%g%l%<@with%>%x' and '%g%l%<@while%>%x'.)

After a few weeks of enjoying %y%lTCZ v2.2%x at Plymouth, it was the end of term, and the long (About 3 months or more) summer holidays began...


%c%l%$The summer re-write...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xOver the summer holidays I had no access to the Internet (I didn't have a modem at the time and there were no Internet Service Providers within 100 miles of my home town either.)

%PAGE
I decided that there was very little chance of the code in its present state ever running reliably, and its design wasn't flexible enough for the developments I had planned for TCZ in the future, so I spent most of my time over the summer holidays taking the entire game apart, re-designing and re-writing large portions of the code from scratch.

Nearing the end of the summer holidays, the more stable and efficient basis for TCZ was nicely taking shape:  The entire database structure had been improved to allow flexibility for future expansion, the socket code (Which handles the Telnet connections of users) had been re-written from scratch and the command-line editor was implemented, along with an early version of the On-line Help System.

Thanks to downloading and installing %c%lLinux 1.0.8%x on my 386DX/40 computer before going home for the summer holidays, I was able to undertake the vast task of redesigning, re-writing and testing the code without any access to the Internet or the UNIX server machines at the university.

%PAGE
Help pages were created from the Official Manual ('%y%lmanual.txt%x') and the finishing touches were put to a number of the main locations in the town (Such as %y%lThe Swan Pub%x, %y%lThe Chatting Zone Luxury Flats%x and several shops.)

Plymouth TCZ was scrapped over the summer holidays.


%c%l%$Term begins again...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe summer holidays passed very quickly, and before I knew it, I was back in London again, living in student accommodation instead of halls of residence.  With just a week to go before lectures started again, I decided to splash out and upgrade my computer.  Soon I was sitting at a 486DX/2 with 8 meg of RAM.

%PAGE
Soon I was back on the Internet, and enjoying the upgrades made to the university's computer network over the holidays:  We now had full Internet access, including Telnet, FTP, etc.  I soon had TCZ installed, compiled and running again on one of the University's machines (%g%latlas.gre.ac.uk%x, port number %g%l8342%x.)  I introduced my two flat mates (%y%lScavy%x and %y%lDemon%x) to TCZ, who very quickly became hooked to it.

Thanks to the re-write over the summer holidays, the game was more stable and often stayed up for longer than a day without crashing.  Most of the original Plymouth TCZ users were soon connecting to TCZ again, and a number of them were recruited to form the new Admin team.  %y%lCrafty%x, %y%lJoliet Jake%x, %y%lNorthernGet%x and %y%lUnicorn%x were given %c%lWizard%x status, along with many other users who were given %y%lApprentice Wizard%x status.

From this point onwards, I started planning and implementing the huge number of ideas and features (Many original and unique) which I had for TCZ and its code.

%PAGE
TCZ very soon had peaks of 15-20 users, so it wasn't long before the staff at the University began to notice it.  One member of University staff began to explore the town and unfortunately wandered into an area built by a user which was slightly X rated.  24-hours later I was forced to shut the game down permanently at the University.


%c%l%$The search for a new site...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xHaving lost our %c%lUniversity of Greenwich%x site (Where TCZ ran for about 2-3 weeks), the long, hard search for a new site began.  During the next month, I sent out E-mails to every Internet Service Provider and suitable site I came across.  After receiving many refusals, and being offered leased line rental at a cost of 300 UK pounds or more per month, an error occurred in my favour.

An E-mailed reply, which was aimed at one of the many Internet Service Providers I had been trying for a site accidentally ended up at a company called %y%lLasermoon Ltd.%x, %y%lUK%x.  It turned out that they were having a 64Kb leased line installed soon and would be setting up an FTP server on it.

%PAGE
As I was the first person who had asked, I was offered the opportunity to put a machine of my own on their network, from which I could run TCZ.  The leased line wouldn't be operational until late November, so I had several weeks to try and get a suitable server machine together.

I still had the motherboard and case of my old 386DX/40, so this, along with the addition of 8 meg of RAM, a 450Mb hard disk and a network card became the basis of a server machine on which to run TCZ.

After having the machine delivered to Lasermoon, I eagerly awaited for their leased line and the machine to go on-line.  Around %y%l5pm%x on %y%lNovember 28th 1994%x, I connected to the machine for the first time (Named %y%lReliant%x (After the Startrek starship, NOT the car :)

%PAGE
Having successfully managed to log on to the machine, I uploaded TCZ's code and compiled it.  At around %y%l6pm%x, users of TCZ when it was at the %c%lUniversity of Greenwich%x got the news they'd been waiting to hear:  %m%lTCZ was back!!!


%c%l%$The Chatting Zone at Lasermoon...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xOne of the biggest problems with starting up The Chatting Zone from its new Lasermoon site was that we had to provide our own server machine on which to run the game.  Being a student, I had very little money to spare, but luckily I had recently upgraded my 386DX/40 to a 486DX/2 66mhz (I still had my 386DX/40, which I originally planned to sell.)

To begin with, the 386 was perfectly adequate (With 8 meg of RAM) to run TCZ (At this time there were only around %c%l2,000%x objects in the database.)  However, the 386 soon began to get overloaded and over worked (Especially when complicated compound commands were executed.)  It did manage to handle 30 users though without getting too bogged down.

%PAGE
A few months on, the 386 was no-longer adequate, and was beginning to run low on memory.  To solve the problem, I bought a 486DX/33 motherboard and an extra 4 meg of RAM  -  This was installed in the machine, giving an instant improvement in speed and giving it 12 meg of RAM.

Around early %y%lMarch 1995%x, we managed to establish a small overseas userbase, which began to increase at a rapid rate, on top of the already established UK userbase, which was also expanding at an equal rate.  It soon became apparent that the Building Point system needed redesigning and replacing with a more controlled system  -  Building Points were scrapped and replaced with Building Quotas (See '%g%l%<quota%>%x'), which allowed us to keep a much tighter control on the expansion rate of the database (At this time, the database was expanding faster than we could cope  -  One week we put in an extra 4 meg of RAM, the next week it was all used up.)

%PAGE
At %y%l5:26pm%x, %y%l28th November 1995%x (Only an hour before TCZ celebrated its first birthday of running at its Lasermoon site), a peak of 100 users was reached for the first time ever.


%c%l%$The move to a new site...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe site at Lasermoon was adequate for over a year, but fairly soon, problems started setting in.  The company needed to use the line to transfer large quantities of data as part of their day-to-day business, which very quickly started causing problems by using up a lot of bandwidth and in turn slowing connections to TCZ down to a crawl.  At first, this wasn't too much of a problem, as it only occurred during business hours.  However, fairly soon, it became a 24-hour problem, and as a result, TCZ and its reputation began to suffer (As long periods of excessive delay (Or 'lag') which were not the fault of TCZ itself spoilt the game for its users.)

%PAGE
By this time, I had already established a good friendship with a local Internet Service Provider (%c%lAngliaNet Ltd%x.) in my home town of %c%lIpswich%x, %c%lEngland%x.  In return for the help and assistance I gave them, I was offered the opportunity to move TCZ's server machine on-site.  This had many advantages, including ample bandwidth and the server machine itself being within a short distance of my home (To upgrade or resolve problems would only require a %c%l10 minute%x journey instead of an expensive %c%l200 mile%x journey to where Lasermoon were based.)

Everything was set, and the move took place.  Some 5000+ E-mails were sent out to users of the game to inform them of its new address, and the major task of changing its address on the 100's of MUD lists on which it was registered began.  After a week, most regular users had found their way to the new location and the number of new users being created began to increase again.

%PAGE
%COMMENT With the move, several other changes took place, including a hardware upgrade to the server machine and the moving of TCZ's FTP (See '%g%l%<ftp%>%x') and World Wide Web (See '%g%l%<www%>%x') sites to its server machine.  The domain '%g%lgalaxsw.co.uk%x' was registered for %y%lGALAX Software Ltd.%x, giving the addresses '%g%ltcz.galaxsw.co.uk%x' for TCZ, '%g%lwww.galaxsw.co.uk%x' for its World Wide Web site and '%g%lftp.galaxsw.co.uk%x' for its FTP archive.  In addition to this, E-mail could now be sent to '%g%ltczadmin@galaxsw.co.uk%x'.

The domain '%g%lgalaxsw.co.uk%x' was registered for %y%lGALAX Software Ltd.%x, giving the addresses '%g%ltcz.galaxsw.co.uk%x' for TCZ, '%g%lwww.galaxsw.co.uk%x' for its World Wide Web site and '%g%lftp.galaxsw.co.uk%x' for its FTP archive.  In addition to this, E-mail could now be sent to '%g%ltczadmin@galaxsw.co.uk%x'.

%c%l%$Miscellaneous...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xTCZ has exceeded all of my original expectations, and there's very little in my original dream of writing the 'ultimate' MUD which hasn't been achieved.  Even after so many years of development, TCZ still presents a steady stream of new programming challenges, along with the enjoyment of implementing them  -  I look forward to continuing the development of the TCZ source code for many years to come, along with help from others now that TCZ is public open source code released under the %c%lGNU General Public License (%c%lGPL%x)  -  See '%g%l%<gpl%>%x'.

%c%l%$TCZ facts...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%y%l*  %xTCZ is pronounced "%y%ltea-sea-zed%x"!

%4%r%l*  %xTCZ's first ever users were:  %y%lJC Digita%x, %y%lRatty%x, %y%lDiceman%x, %y%lUK1%x and %y%lThe Captain%x.

%4%y%l*  %xTCZ's first ever overseas user to be promoted to Admin (%y%lApprentice Wizard%x) status was:  %y%lPrice%x (Now known as %c%lSteve%x.)

%4%r%l*  %xTCZ went on-line for the first time at its %c%lLasermoon%x site on %y%l28th November 1994%x at %y%l6pm%x (%y%lGMT%x)

%4%y%l*  %xTCZ's first ever peak of over %c%l100 users%x occurred on %y%l28th November 1995%x at %y%l5:26pm%x (%y%lGMT%x)  -  Almost exactly one year after TCZ first opened to the public.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %xAs of %y%l12th August 1996%x, there were over %c%lhalf a million%x connections to TCZ, and over %c%l35,000%x characters created since %y%lMarch 1995%x (When recording of statistical data was first implemented.)  The highest ever peak so far is currently %y%l122 users simultaneously%x.

%4%y%l*  %xOn %y%lSunday 22nd June 1997%x, %c%lone million connections%x to %@%m was reached.

%4%r%l*  %xThe longest recorded uptime of TCZ (Total running time, without being shutdown for a code update, shutdown by a power failure or crashing) is well over %y%l7 months%x.

%4%y%l*  %xThe %y%lTCZ 2000 Project%x commenced on %c%l11th April 1999%x.  This ended nearly %c%lfive years%x of sole maintenance and development by %y%lJ.P.Boggis%x (Aka %y%lJC Digita%x) by introducing %y%lSimon A. Boggis%x (Aka %y%lBadpenny%x) to the source code and the creation of plans for TCZ's long term future.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %xAs of %y%l22nd March 2000%x, the TCZ v4.3.0 source code consists of %c%l51%x source files, totaling %c%l3665kb%x in size and %c%l61,327%x lines.

%4%y%l*  %xOn %y%lWednesday 30th May 2000%x, the original %y%lThe Chatting Zone%x (%y%lTCZ%x) MUD was finally closed after over %c%lsix years%x of running.

%4%r%l*  %xOn %y%lWednesday 23 May 2001%x, the original %y%lThe Chatting Zone%x (%y%lTCZ%x) MUD database was re-opened as part of an official research project of the %c%lInformation, Media and Communication (IMC) Research Group%x in the %c%lDepartment of Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London%x.

%4%y%l*  %xOn %y%lThursday 20th November 2003%x, TCZ was moved to a new dedicated machine in the Department of Computer Science, Queen Mary, University of London.

%4%r%l*  %xThe %y%lTCZ source code%x was released publicly under the %c%lGNU General Public License%x (%c%lGPL%x) on %y%l02/12/2004%x (See '%g%l%<gpl%>%x' and visit %b%l%u%{@?link "" "https://github.com/smcvey/tcz" "Click to visit the TCZ project web site..."}%x)

%c%l%$Do you remember...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%4%y%l*  %xWhen the town didn't exist, and the main locations (Of which there were very few at the time) were all accessed from a room called '%y%lThe Crossroads%x'?  (%y%lRatty%x, %y%lDiceman%x, %y%lUK1%x and %y%lThe Captain%x probably will %m%l:)
%4%r%l*  %xWhen you couldn't have spaces in your name or name prefixes/suffixes?
%4%y%l*  %xWhen you had to type '%g%lconnect <NAME> <PASSWORD>%x' to connect?
%4%r%l*  %xWhen there was no ANSI %r%lc%g%lo%y%ll%b%lo%m%lu%c%lr%x support (In the very early Plymouth days)?
%4%y%l*  %xWhen there was a code update almost every day to fix major bugs and implement new features?
%4%r%l*  %xWhen an uptime of more than 1 day was extremely rare?
%4%y%l*  %xWhen there was no %(World Wide Web Interface%)?
%4%r%l*  %xWhen %@%m ran on a 386 PC with 8Mb RAM?
%4%y%l*  %xWhen you had to use '%g%l%(@desc%)%x' and lots of protecting backslashes to write compound commands (Before the %(editor%) was implemented.)
%4%r%l*  %xWhen the %y%lTCZ source code%x was not publicly released under the %c%lGNU General Public License%x (%c%lGPL%x)?  -  See '%g%l%<gpl%>%x'.

%4%r%l*  %xInheritance  -  Standard fields (Description, success, failure, etc.), locks, aliases (Characters only) and object lists (Contents, exits, compound commands, etc.) of an object may be inherited from a parent object  -  See '%g%l%<inheritance%>%x'.

%4%y%l*  %xUnique Building Quota system  -  Each character has a Building Quota that restricts the maximum amount of stuff they can have built at any one time (Of course, the character must be a Builder to build anything in the first place.)  Building Quotas replace the old and obsolete Building Points system  -  See '%g%l%<@quota%>%x'.

%4%y%l*  %xTwo distinctive types of administrator  -  %c%lWizard%x ranks (Building orientated), who should be your first choice for building help and advice, and %c%lDruid%x ranks (Non-building orientated), who are there to help out new users, non-building related questions/problems from existing users and to sort out problems between users and abusive users, etc.  See '%g%l%<druid%>%x' and '%g%l%<wizard%>%x'.

%4%r%l*  %xArticle support  -  Article specific flags may be set on objects to add the correct article ('%c%la%x', '%c%lan%x' or '%c%lsome%x') to the object automatically, and to all references to it (E.g:  '%r%l%uA%y%l chair%x', '%r%l%uAn%y%l oak chest%x', '%r%l%uSome%y%l sweets%x')  -  See '%g%l%<articles%>%x'.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %x'Interactive' prompting via the '%g%l%(@prompt%)%x' command  -  Allows creation of menus, knowledge tests, etc. where the user can enter their choice/answer at a prompt, rather than having to type a command followed by their choice/answer  -  See '%g%l%<@prompt%>%x'.

%4%r%l*  %xUsers can tie the knot virtually and be 'net' married to each other  -  See '%g%l%<@partner%>%x'.

%4%y%l*  %xSystem for handing out '%c%lread%x', '%c%lwrite%x', %c%lcreate%x and %c%ldestroy%x permissions to other characters (Allowing them access to your objects) via friend flags.  Both full and restricted access may be given, allowing other users to help you with your building projects and/or work on them with you, and large building projects to be worked on by groups of users  -  See '%g%l%<fset%>%x' and '%g%l%<group building%>%x'.

%4%r%l*  %xAbility to recover accidentally destroyed objects  -  See '%g%l%<@undestroy%>%x'.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %xAutomatic maintenance of unused characters and objects in the database, helping keep the database free of redundant objects.  Redundant characters and objects are destroyed on a weekly basis  -  See '%g%l%<expiry%>%x', '%g%l%<@expiry%>%x', '%g%l%<junked objects%>%x', '%g%l%<date stamps%>%x', '%g%l%<@admin%>%x' and '%g%l%<@maintenance%>%x'.

%4%r%l*  %xUser creatable vehicles, which can be driven/ridden around the world of %@%n (In locations which allow transport, such as streets, etc.)  -  See '%g%l%<transport%>%x'.

%4%y%l*  %xE-mail forwarding facility for users of %@%m  -  See '%g%l%<@email%>%x'.

%4%r%l*  %xAutomatically generated user home pages list and gallery of user pictures.  This is generated by %@%m through its World Wide Web Interface (See '%g%l%<html%>%x'), and is available from %@%m's web site (See '%g%l%<www%>%x'.)  Scans (See '%g%l%<scan%>%x') and profiles (See '%g%l%<profile%>%x') of users are also available too through the World Wide Web Interface.

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %xSystem and user log files, making administration easy by allowing administrators to browse categorised log files without requiring access to the server machine.  User log files allow %(Builders%) to see failed commands typed by users within their areas, as well as logging their own custom entries using '%g%l%(@logentry%)%x'.  (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x' and '%g%l%<@logentry%>%x'.)

%4%r%l*  %xLow maintenance  -  Automatic database consistency checking and maintenance (Such as deleting unused characters) makes life easier for the administrators of %@%n.  (See '%g%l%<@maintenance%>%x'.)

%4%y%l*  %xZero Memory Database Dumping  -  Allows the %@%m database to be dumped to disk in the background without forking a separate process or using any extra memory on the server machine, preventing %@%m from 'lagging' when the database dumps.

%PAGE
%4%r%l*  %xForked database dump for operating systems which properly support copy-on-write memory pages (Such as recent versions of %y%lLinux%x.)  This has the advantage of being quick (Taking only a few minutes to dump a large database) and subject to no inconsistencies.  This is recommended rather than the Zero Memory dump.  Falls back to the Zero Memory dump if the forked dump fails for any reason.

%4%y%l*  %xCommand-line start-up options and configuration file support, allowing many parameters to be changed without needing to recompile the source code.

%TITLE Help on gaining %w%lresidency%x on %@%n
On many Talker/MUD systems, you need to obtain permanent residency in order to keep your character after you log out.

On %@%n, you %c%ldo not%x need to obtain residency  -  Your character will be kept after you log out (With the exception of Guest Characters, who are temporary (Please ask a member of Admin to create a character for you if you are logged in as a Guest Character.))  All we ask is that you use your character regularly, and you do not have more than %c%lONE%x character for your own personal use.

%@%n automatically checks for unused characters on a regular basis, and deletes any who have not been used for a significant period of time (See '%g%l%<timeout%>%x' for more details.)

%TITLE Help on %w%lautomatic character deletion%x
If you don't connect for some time, your character may be %r%lautomatically deleted%x by %@%n.  If you don't want this to happen, please make sure you connect regularly.  The allowed times are detailed when you disconnect from the game (A period of %y%l200 days%x is usually allowed for a Builder, %y%l100 days%x for a Mortal and %y%l1 month%x for 'newbies' (Characters with less than %c%l1 day%x total connect time.))

If you are going to be away from the Internet for longer than these times, and will be returning afterwards, please ask a member of Admin to set your %y%l%(PERMANENT%)%x flag, which will prevent your character from being automatically destroyed.

%TITLE Help on %w%lgroup building projects%x
If you and your proposed group are starting a building project from scratch, you may like to ask a member of Admin to create a character for the purpose with an appropriate Building Quota limit, with all members of the group being given full '%c%lread%x' and '%c%lwrite%x' permissions to this character (I.e:  '%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = read write create destroy !sharable%x'.)

All work on the building project should then be done under the ownership of this character (Using the '%g%l@chuid%x' (See '%g%l%<@chuid%>%x') command when working on the project.)  This will prevent problems arising if a member of the group suddenly decides to pull out or a new member joins the group, and will keep all of the building project together in one place, owned by a single character.  The password of this character should only be disclosed to the founder (Or user in charge) of the group, allowing them to remain in full control of the group and building project.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%ledit <OBJECT TYPE> [<FIELD>] <OBJECT NAME>
        edit [<FIELD>] <OBJECT>%]%x

Starts %@%n's built in editor.

The first form creates an object of the type %y%l<OBJECT TYPE>%x with the name %y%l<OBJECT NAME>%x.  If %y%l<FIELD>%x is specified, that field of the new object will be edited, otherwise it will assume you want to edit its description.

The second form starts editing the object %y%l<OBJECT>%x, which must already exist.  If %y%l<FIELD>%x is specified, that field of the object will be edited, otherwise it will assume you want to edit its description.

The editor can be used to edit the elements of a dynamic array (Only one element may be edited at a time though.)  To do this, simply specify the name of the array along with the element number to edit in square brackets, e.g:  '%g%l%(edit%) myarray[2]%x' will start editing %c%lelement 2%x of the dynamic array '%y%lmyarray%x'.

You can use the '%g%l%(.element%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<.element%>%x') to start editing other elements of the dynamic array without leaving the editor (Works in a similar way to '%g%l%(.field%)%x' (See '%g%l%<.field%>%x'.))

%y%l<FIELD>%x can be one of the following...

%g%l%(description%)%x ('%g%l%(desc%)%x'), %g%l%(failure%)%x ('%g%l%(fail%)%x'), %g%l%(success%)%x ('%g%l%(succ%)%x'), %g%l%(drop%)%x, %g%l%(odescription%)%x ('%g%l%(odesc%)%x'), %g%l%(ofailure%)%x ('%g%l%(ofail%)%x'), %g%l%(osuccess%)%x ('%g%l%(osucc%)%x'), %g%l%(odrop%)%x.

%y%l<OBJECT TYPE>%x can be one of the following...

%g%l%(Array%)%x, %g%l%(command%)%x, %g%l%(exit%)%x, %g%l%(property%)%x, %g%l%(room%)%x, %g%l%(thing%)%x, %g%l%(variable%)%x.

%c%l%$How to use the editor...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
To begin with (Providing you don't move to a different line), any text you type that doesn't begin with a '%y%l.%x' will be added to the end of the edit text (The text of the field you're currently editing.)

If you move to a different line, any text you type (Which doesn't begin with a '%y%l.%x') will be inserted above the current line (Or will overwrite the current line if overwrite mode is %c%lon%x.)  '%g%l%(.overwrite%) on%x' turns overwrite mode %c%lon%x and '%g%l%(.overwrite%) off%x' turns it %c%loff%x.

By default, the editor %c%lWILL NOT%x evaluate any %y%l{}%x's, %y%l$%x's or %y%l\%x's, meaning you can edit compound commands without having to put a '%g%l\%x' in front of every '%y%l{%x' and '%y%l$%x'.  This feature makes the editor perfect for editing/creating compound commands without any of the confusion usually involved due to all those annoying %y%l\%x's!

%PAGE
You %c%lCAN%x however make the editor evaluate %y%l{}%x's, %y%l$%x's and %y%l\%x's by typing '%g%l%(.evaluate%) yes%x' (And stop it again by typing '%g%l%(.evaluate%) no%x'.)

Don't confuse '%g%l%(.evaluate%)%x' with '%g%l%(@evaluate%)%x'  -  They're two completely different commands.

The '%g%l%(.view%)%x' or '%g%l%(.display%)%x' command displays the edit text around the current line you're editing (Try it 'n' see)  -  The line that begins with something looking like '%g%l[001->%x' is the line you're currently editing (This is highlighted too if you're taking advantage of %@%m's %c%lANSI colour support%x (See '%g%l%<ansi colour%>%x') or have have your terminal type set correctly (See '%g%l%<set termtype%>%x'.))

'%g%l%(.view%)%x' can be shortened to '%g%l%(.v%)%x', and both '%g%l%(.view%)%x' and '%g%l%(.display%)%x' can be given an optional line number to display from, e.g:  '%g%l%(.v%) 1%x' to view the edit text from line %y%l1%x, regardless of the line you're currently editing.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Moving around the text...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can either use '%g%l%(.up%)%x' and '%g%l%(.down%)%x', or '%g%l%(.prev%)%x' and '%g%l%(.next%)%x' to move up and down the text by one line ('%g%l%(.up%)%x' and '%g%l%(.down%)%x' are the most easiest to use, as they can be shortened to '%g%l%(.u%)%x' and '%g%l%(.d%)%x'.)

You can move up/down by more than one line by typing '%g%l%(.up%) <COUNT>%x' and '%g%l%(.down%) <COUNT>%x', where %y%l<COUNT>%x is the number of lines to move up/down by.

'%g%l%(.home%)%x' and '%g%l%(.end%)%x' can be used to move to the beginning and end of the text respectively.

'%g%l%(.goto%)%x', '%g%l%(.line%)%x' or '%g%l%(.position%)%x' can be used to go to any line in the edit text (So you can edit it.)  All of these can be shortened, e.g:  '%g%l%(.g%)%x', '%g%l%(.l%)%x' and '%g%l%(.p%)%x'  -  If you don't specify which line number to go to, the current line number you're editing is displayed along with details of whatever you're currently editing.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Saving or abandoning your changes...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
If you want to abandon the changes you've made to whatever field you're editing, you can do this by typing '%g%l%(.abort%) = yes%x' or '%g%l%(.cancel%) = yes%x'.

If you're happy with your changes, you can save them by typing '%g%l%(.exit%)%x', '%g%l%(.quit%)%x', '%g%l%(.save%)%x' or '%g%l%(.leave%)%x'.


%c%l%$Editing a different field without leaving the editor...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can edit a different field of the object you're currently editing by typing '%g%l%(.field%) <FIELD>%x', e.g:  '%g%l%(.field%) fail%x' to start editing the %y%lfail message%x of the object.

Before editing the specified field, any changes you've made to the current field will be saved.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Line ranges...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
Any editor command that has %y%l<LINE RANGE>%x as one of its parameters can accept a range of lines (Or a single line) to operate on.

A line range is specified as follows...

%[%c%l3-8%x       ...Line range from line %y%l3%x to line %y%l8%x.
%c%l3..8%x      ...Same as above.
%c%l3%x         ...Line %y%l3%x only (Equivalent to %c%l3-3%x.)%]

%PAGE
Instead of specifying line numbers, you can use one of the following five special keywords instead  -  These are...

%[%c%lCURRENT   %x...Current line that you're editing.
%c%lFIRST     %x...First line of edit text.
%c%lLAST      %x...Last line.
%c%lEND       %x...Same as above.
%c%lALL       %x...The whole edit text (Equivalent to %c%lFIRST-LAST%x.)%]

%c%lNOTE:%x  You don't have to type them in capitals if you don't want to.


%c%l%$The Editor Prompt...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
When using the editor, you should get a prompt that looks something like this...

%c[%c%l4%c:%c%l7%c]-->%x

%PAGE
The number on the left-hand side of the '%c:%x' is the line number you're currently editing, and the number on the right-hand side is the total number of lines in the text you're editing.  Don't worry if the number on the left is greater than the one on the right  -  This just means you're adding to the end of the text.


%c%l%$Editor commands...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
For a complete list of all editor commands, see '%g%l%<edit commands%>%x' or '%g%l%<editcmds%>%x' (Type '%g%l%(.help%)%x' instead of '%g%l%(help%)%x' if you're using the editor!)

'%g%l.replace%x' replaces the specified %y%l<OCCURENCE>%x of %y%l<SEARCHSTR>%x (Within the given %y%l<LINERANGE>%x) with %y%l<REPLACESTR>%x.

If %y%l<LINERANGE>%x isn't specified, the current line is assumed.

For %y%l<OCCURENCE>%x, an occurence number can be given (I.e:  '%y%l2%x' for the %c%lsecond%x occurence, '%y%l3%x' for the %c%lthird%x, etc.), or one of the keywords '%y%lFIRST%x', '%y%lLAST%x' or '%y%lALL%x' (Replace %c%lALL%x occurences within given %y%l<LINERANGE>%x.)  If %y%l<OCCURENCE>%x is prefixed with a '%y%l+%x', the given %y%l<OCCURENCE>%x will be replaced on %c%lEVERY%x line in the %y%l<LINERANGE>%x.

If %y%l<OCCURENCE>%x is omitted, the first occurence of %y%l<SEARCHSTR>%x will be assumed.

You can view the other pages of messages by typing '%g%lread page <NUMBER>%x' (Or '%g%lview page <NUMBER>%x'), where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the number of the page you'd like to view, e.g:  '%g%lread page 1%x' will show you the first page of messages in the topic/sub-topic.

%PAGE
To read a message, simply type '%g%lread <NUMBER>%x' (Or '%g%lview <NUMBER>%x'), where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the number of the message, e.g:  '%g%lread 43%x' will read message number %c%l43%x in your current selected topic/sub-topic.  Once you've read a message, you can type '%g%lread next%x' to read the next message in the topic/sub-topic and '%g%lread prev%x' to read the previous message.

The '%g%lread unread%x' BBS command reads the next message on the BBS which you haven't read yet (If the next unread message is in another topic/sub-topic, your current selected topic/sub-topic will be changed automatically for you.)  You can effectively use this command to read every single unread message on the BBS.

%PAGE
The '%g%lread ignored%x' BBS command reads the next unread message on the BBS which you have ignored using the 'ignore' BBS command (If the next unread message is in another topic/sub-topic, your current selected topic/sub-topic will be changed automatically for you.)

The '%g%lmessages%x' BBS command is identical to the '%g%lread%x'/'%g%lview%x' BBS commands, except that it omits (Ignores) replies to messages.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Registering your vote
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l[bbs] vote <NUMBER> [=] yes|no|abstain%]%x

To register your vote on a votable message, simply type '%g%lvote <NUMBER> for%x', '%g%lvote <NUMBER> against%x' or '%g%lvote <NUMBER> abstain%x' (If appropriate) to register your vote appropriately on the message.  For example, you could vote %c%lFOR%x the message number %y%l71%x in your current selected topic/sub-topic by typing '%g%lvote 71 for%x'.

Once you've voted, you can change the direction of your vote, if you decide otherwise before the vote is closed.  To change your vote, simply cast it again on the message, in the appropriate direction.  Your previous vote will be erased, and your new vote registered in its place.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Making a message votable
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l[bbs] vote <NUMBER> [=] on|off|reset%]%x

Any message can be made votable by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> on%x'.  This will allow users to vote on the message appropriately.  You can 'close' the vote (So that no-one else can vote or change their vote) by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> off%x'.  If you wish to clear the results of the vote (I.e:  To start the vote again), you can do this by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> reset%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Making votes subject to a secret ballot
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l[bbs] vote <NUMBER> [=] secret|public%]%x

Voting on a message can be made subject to a secret ballot (I.e:  The current results of the vote are not shown to users reading the message) by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> secret%x'.  The results can be revealed (I.e:  Once you've closed the vote) by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> public%x'.

%c%l%$Making votes subject to the majority factor
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l[bbs] vote <NUMBER> [=] majority|normal%]%x

Voting on a message can also be made subject to the %(majority factor%).  This weights votes according to the rank of the user casting the vote (I.e:  So that higher ranking users have more influence.)  Please see '%g%l%<majority factor%>%x' for further details, including how the weighting is organised.  Voting on a message can be made subject to the majority factor by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> majority%x'.  Voting can also be made subject to normal majority (Equal weighting) again by typing '%g%lvote <NUMBER> normal%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Setting an expiry time for voting
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l[bbs] vote <NUMBER> [=] expiry <DAYS>%]%x

An expiry time can be set for voting on a message.  Once set, voting on the message will remain open for that period of time, after which it will automatically close.  If the vote has been made subject to a secret ballot, the results of the vote will be made public when it closes.

To set an expiry time for voting on a message, simply type '%g%lvote <NUMBER> expiry <DAYS>%x', where %y%l<DAYS>%x is the time in days (Up to a maximum of %c%l7%x), after which voting on the message will close.

Once an expiry time has been set, it cannot be reduced or removed.  Voting on the message cannot be turned on/off, and the votes on the message cannot be reset.  The voting can be made subject to a secret ballot, but cannot be made public again.  These restrictions apply until the expiry time for voting on the message has passed.

%PAGE
However, the expiry time can be increased, if more time is required for the vote (To do this, simply set an expiry time higher than the current time remaining.)

%m%lDeities%x and the %m%lSupreme Being%x can use the '%g%lvote <NUMBER> list%x' command to list the names of users who have cast votes in each direction.  This BBS command is restricted to %m%lDeities%x and the %m%lSupreme Being%x to prevent the privacy and confidentiality of users casting votes being breached.

The '%g%lappend%x' BBS command appends to the bottom of a BBS message.

If %y%l<MESSAGE>%x (Your message) is specified, it will be appended to the message on the BBS immediately.  Otherwise, %@%n Editor (See '%g%l%<editor%>%x') will be started, so you can write your message (Type it in a line at a time, and then type '%g%l%(.save%)%x' on a line by itself to exit the editor and append it to the message on the BBS.)

The main use of the '%g%lappend%x' BBS command is to make additions to a message you've posted on the BBS at a later date, after it has been read by a number of other users.

Appending to the message will also mark it as unread again (For everyone), so that people who have already read the message in the past know to read it again (So that they can see your append to the message.)

%PAGE
If you need to add to or change a message straight after posting, you should use the '%g%l%(^bbs modify%)%x' BBS command (See '%g%l%<bbs modify%>%x'.)  Otherwise, you should append to the message, so that it's marked as being unread again (The '%g%l%(^bbs modify%)%x' BBS command doesn't do this.)

%y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above may append to any message, regardless of who posted it (Even if it was posted by a higher level administrator.)

You can use '%g%lappendanon%x' instead of '%g%lappend%x' to anonymously append to a message on the BBS.

You can prevent a message from being appended to by using '%g%l[bbs] append <NUMBER> = off%x', where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the number of the message.  No user (Including yourself) will be able to append to the message, unless '%g%l[bbs] append <NUMBER> = on%x' is used to allow appending again.

The maximum number of sub-topics allowed within a topic can be set using the '%g%l%(^bbs subtopiclimit%)%x' BBS command (The default is %y%l16%x  -  See '%g%l%<bbs subtopiclimit%>%x'.)

The default message limit of a new topic/sub-topic is %y%l100%x messages.

Unless a lower message limit is required in a particular topic/sub-topic, changing the message limit of a topic/sub-topic is not usually necessary.  Most topics should be subject to cyclic message deletion (See '%g%l%<bbs cyclic%>%x'), and %y%l100%x messages should be ample to support several days (If not weeks in some topics) worth of posting.

The '%g%lownertopic%x' BBS command can be used to change the owner of topic or sub-topic on the BBS to another character (Including Mortal characters), e.g:  '%g%lownertopic clubs/new club = fred bloggs%x' will change the owner of the sub-topic '%y%lNew Club%x' in the topic '%y%lClubs%x' to the character '%y%lFred Bloggs%x'.

One use of this command is to give a Mortal user ownership of their own topic or sub-topic, which they can then be responsible for maintaining.  For example, a Mortal user may have set up a club/social group with other users, and wishes to have a sub-topic in the topic '%y%lClubs%x' for members to post messages to.

%PAGE
The owner of a topic/sub-topic has the authority to append to, delete, etc. messages left by other users (Including users of a higher rank), even if they are a Mortal user.

When giving a topic to a Mortal user, the sub-topic limit (See '%g%l%<bbs subtopiclimit%>%x') of the topic should be reduced (Or even zeroed.)  This can be done using the '%g%l%(^bbs subtopiclimit%)%x' BBS command, i.e:  '%g%l%(^bbs subtopiclimit%) <TOPIC> = 0%x' will prevent the owner of the topic from creating any sub-topics within it.

The '%g%ltimelimit%x' BBS command can be used to set a time limit (Expiry time) on messages within a topic/sub-topic on the BBS.

%y%l<LIMIT>%x is the time limit (In days) of messages within the topic/sub-topic, e.g:  '%g%ltimelimit general = 30%x' will impose a time limit of %c%l30 days%x on messages in the topic '%y%lGeneral%x'.

When a time limit is set, any messages which have not been read for that number of days or greater will be automatically deleted.  Deletion takes place automatically on a daily basis.

%PAGE
This BBS command is most useful for topics/sub-topics which don't see too much activity (I.e:  Messages could remain in the topic/sub-topic for months, without being read by any further users.)  A time limit of a month or so (%y%l30 days%x) will help ensure messages in these topics/sub-topics are deleted when interest in them ceases, freeing up the memory used by the messages.

Popular topics/sub-topics don't really need a time limit, as older messages will be deleted as a result of cyclic deletion (See '%g%l%<bbs cyclic%>%x') after sufficient new messages have been posted.

%TITLE Help on %w%lsub-topics%x
%c%l%8NOTE:  %xPlease see '%g%l%<bbs subtopics%>%x' for help on the BBS '%g%l%(^bbs subtopics%)%x' command.

Topics on %@%n BBS may contain sub-topics.  This allows topics on the BBS to be organised, with topics containing related sub-topics.

In general, all BBS commands which need to be given a %y%l<TOPIC>%x as one of their parameters can also be used to create and maintain sub-topics.  A sub-topic is refered to in the following format:  %y%l<TOPIC>/<SUB-TOPIC>%x

For example, you could refer to the sub-topic '%y%lGeneral%x' in the topic '%y%lNews%x' using '%y%lNews/General%x'.

To add a new sub-topic, you'd simply use '%g%l%(^bbs addtopic%) <TOPIC>/<SUB-TOPIC> = <DESCRIPTION>%x', where %y%l<TOPIC>%x is the name of the topic to add it to, %y%l<SUB-TOPIC>%x is the name to give the sub-topic and %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x is the short description to give the sub-topic.

%PAGE
All of the settings and restrictions which can be applied to topics can also be applied to individual sub-topics, such as whether messages can be added, the access level required, etc.  In order to access a sub-topic, you must have access to the topic in which it's located.

%8%c%lNOTE:  %xSub-topics can't contain further sub-topics.

If a topic contains sub-topics, it's usual practise to leave the topic itself empty (I.e:  Move any of the messages in it into its sub-topics) and prevent new messages being added to it, using the '%g%l%(^bbs allowadd%) <TOPIC> = no%x' BBS command (See '%g%l%<bbs allowadd%>%x'.)  By doing this, users selecting the topic (Using the '%g%l%(^bbs topic%) <TOPIC>%x' BBS command  -  See '%g%l%<bbs topic%>%x') will be automatically presented with a list of sub-topics in the topic, to choose from.

%4%r%l*  %xFull 16 %r%lc%g%lo%y%ll%b%lo%m%lu%c%lr%x ANSI emulation with support for %fflashing%x, %uunderlined%x, %z%l%i%winverted%x text and %i%rtext%x %i%gbackground%x %i%bcolours%x.

%4%y%l*  %xFull hypertext edition of the On-line Help System%| (You're using it now!)%|, complete with links between topics and search facility.  It can also be used externally from %@%m, without even connecting a character.

%4%r%l*  %xSplit windows for input (Typing commands) and output with scroll back and automatic scrolling (JAVA Script required.)

%PAGE
%4%y%l*  %xFull editing on command line (So you can correct typing mistakes, etc.) and recall/edit of previous typed command.

%4%r%l*  %xHTML support within %@%m  -  You can use HTML in your description, building projects, etc.  Most HTML features supported by web browsers can be used, including hyperlinks and images.

%4%y%l*  %xAll internal ('hard coded') commands within %@%m have been coded to take advantage of the World Wide Web Interface, using text formatting, tables, clickable links and buttons, etc.

%4%r%l*  %xUnlike some 'Web Chat' programs, you do not need to continuously reload the page to get output.  The output window stays connected to %@%m (Just like a Telnet connection) with output being delivered as and when it occurs.

%4%y%l*  %xSSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections are supported for increased privacy and security (Providing your browser supports SSL and it is legal to use encryption software in your country.)

%PAGE
%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xThe above features are subject to the World Wide Web browser you are currently using.  Some web browsers may implement some (Or all) of the above features differently or may not support them at all.


%c%l%$Connecting through the World Wide Web Interface...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xConnecting to %@%m through the World Wide Web Interface is simple:  Just type the URL of %@%n's web site ('%b%l%u%{@?link "" "{%@%w}" "{%@%n}'s Web Site"}%x') into your browser.

Once the web site has loaded, simply click on %y%lConnect Character%x menu item and you will be presented with a fill-in form.  Simply type in your character's %c%lname%x and %c%lpassword%x and then click on the '%y%lConnect to %@%m...%x' button to connect.

Before connecting your character, you should check the %y%lWorld Wide Web Interface Preferences%x at the bottom of the form, which are as follows:

%PAGE

%c%l%$Use your saved preferences.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xThis option doesn't appear on the character creation form.

%@%m remembers the options you first used for connecting through the World Wide Web Interface.  If you leave this option checked, %@%m will ignore any options you set on the connect/create forms and use your saved preferences instead.  This saves you from having to set your options and/or alternative background image every time you connect.

If you wish to change your preferences, simply uncheck this option and then set the rest of the options to your preferred settings.  On connecting, your saved preferences will be updated to the new settings.

You can also change your saved preferences within %@%m.  Typing '%g%l%(set%)%x' (See '%g%l%<set%>%x') will display your usual %@%m preferences, along with a fill-in form (Similar to that found on the character connection form) which shows you your current saved preferences.  You can change these on the form appropriately and then click on the '%y%lSave preferences...%x' button to save your new preferences.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Enable SSL (Secure Socket Layer) connections.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf your browser supports %m%lSSL%x (%y%lSecure Socket Layer%x) connections, you can enable this option to use secure encrypted connections while connected to %@%m, ensuring complete confidentiality and security of information sent to/received from %@%m.  Ideal safeguard against 'packet sniffing' on your network.

%9%4%r%l%uIMPORTANT%r%l:  %y%lUse of encryption software may be %r%l%uillegal%y%l in some countries.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Enable JAVA Script enhancements.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf your web browser supports %m%lJAVA Script%x, you can enable this option to make the World Wide Web Interface easier and more user-friendly to use.

   %4%c%l%$Use new scrolling method (Requires JAVA Script 1.2)
   %~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   %4%xThis option will automatically scroll the output window when activity occurs in it (I.e:  Speech from another user, or output from command you send to %@%m.)  You will need a recent browser with support for %m%lJAVA Script 1.2%x to use this option.

   %4%c%l%$Use old scrolling method (Recommended for older browsers.)
   %~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   %4%xThis option also automatically scrolls the output window, but uses an older method, which should work with many older browsers.  It is not perfect though, and may scroll incorrectly in some browsers (Especially newer ones, where you should be using the new scrolling method instead.)

%PAGE

   %4%c%l%$Automatically set focus to '%@%m command:' box.
   %~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%{@?pad {@?strlen "{%@%m}"} "~"}
   %xThis option automatically sets the focus back to the '%y%l%@%m command:%x' box, so that you do not need to click on it or %g%lTAB%x to it every time you send a command to %@%m (Highly recommended.)

   %8%4%c%lNOTE:  %xIf you get JAVA Script error messages, you will need to obtain a more recent browser, or disable the JAVA enhancements altogether (Not recommended.)


%c%l%$Enable Cascading Style-Sheets enhancements.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf your browser supports %y%lCascading Style-Sheets%x, you can enable this option to take advantage of some page layout enhancements, along with %y%l%i%r%|%h<FONT STYLE="background:#FF0000;">%h%|text background colours%|%h</FONT>%h%|%x (Ensure that you also enable %y%lcoloured text%x.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Enable coloured text.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf this option is checked, %y%l<FONT COLOR>%x tags will be used to display %r%lc%g%lo%y%ll%b%lo%m%lu%c%lr%r%le%g%ld%x text.  Coloured text simulates ANSI colour, which is supported and used extensively throughout %@%m.

To use this option (Enabled by default), your browser must be able to support %y%l<FONT COLOR>%x tags (Such as %c%lNetscape Navigator 2.0%x and %c%lMicrosoft Internet Explorer 2.0%x and better.)

If you have a slow connection to %@%m, you may wish to turn off this option to improve the performance of your connection (The simulation of ANSI colour generates a suitable %y%l<FONT COLOR>%x tag for each colour change.)

%8%c%lNOTE:  %xYou may also wish to enable %y%lCascading Style-Sheets%x, which will also give you text background colours.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Enable automatically formatted links.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf this option is checked, you will see properly formatted hyperlinks that you can click on, whereever the following link styles are used:

%b%l%uwww.domain%x
%b%l%uhttp://www.domain%x
%b%l%umailto:user@domain%x


%c%l%$Enable graphical smileys (Emoticons.)
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf this option is checked, you will see graphical icon smileys (Emoticons) instead of their text-based equivalents (E.g:  %|:-) instead of %|'%m%l:%l-%l)%x'.)  Smileys are used by users to express emotions in conversation.  See '%g%l%<smileys%>%x' for a list of graphical smileys you can use on %@%m.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Italic text instead of underlined text.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xSome old browsers do not support and ignore the %|%h<U>%h%|%uunderline%x%|%h</U>%h%| (%y%l<U>%x ... %y%l</U>%x) tag.  For this reason, %|%h<I>%h%|italics%x%|%h</I>%h%| (%y%l<I>%x ... %y%l</I>%x) tags can be used instead as an alternative to %|%h<U>%h%|%uunderlined%x%|%h</U>%h%| text.  If your browser supports %|%h<U>%h%|%uunderlined%x%|%h</U>%h%| text, you should not enable this option.


%c%l%$Use alternative background image.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xBy default, %@%m will usually use a standard background image (Such as a dark hexagonal %@%m logo) behind the text in the output window.

You may wish to disable using a background image altogether (Especially if your computer cannot display at least %c%l256 colours simultaneously%x, which will result in a grainy looking background.)  To do this, simply check the '%y%lUse alternative background image%x' option and leave the box blank.

%PAGE
Alternatively, you can use your own custom background image.  This can be a local image stored on your computer or an image stored on any public World Wide Web server you have access to.  Simply check the '%y%lUse alternative background image%x' option and type the URL of your preferred background into the box, e.g:

%[   %g%lfile:/mypics/mybackground.gif
   http://www.webserver.com/myhomepage/mybackground.gif%]%x

If the background image you use is light in colour, you may need to check the '%y%lReverse foreground and background text colours%x' option, otherwise some text in the output window may be difficult to read.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xIf the '%y%lUse alternative background image%x' option is unchecked, the default background will always be used.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Reverse foreground and background text colours.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe default colours for the World Wide Web Interface is white and coloured text on a black background.  If you are using an alternative background image which is light in colour, you may need to check this option to switch the colours black and white, so that you are given black and coloured text on a white background.  If you don't do this, you may find some text hard to read.


%c%l%$Width of '%@%m command:' input box.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%{@?pad {@?strlen "{%@%m}"} "~"}
%xIf you have a high-resolution display, you may like to increase the width of the '%c%l%@%m command:%x' input box to take full advantage of it.  Alternatively, you may need to reduce the width.

%PAGE

%c%l%$How to use the World Wide Web Interface...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xWhen you connect to %@%m through the World Wide Web Interface, your browser screen will split into two windows:  A small input window (Small lower section), into which you type your commands to %@%m, and a large output window (Large upper section), where you will see output resulting from your commands and activity of other users.


%c%l%$Creating a new character through the World Wide Web Interface...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xCreating a character through the World Wide Web Interface is simple:  Just type the URL of %@%m's web site ('%b%l%u%{@?link "" "{%@%w}" "{%@%n}'s Web Site"}%x') into your browser.

Once the web site has loaded, simply click on %y%lCreate Character%x menu item and you will be presented with a fill-in form.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xYou will need to fill in %r%l%uall%x of the options below in-order to create a new character.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Connect as a Guest Character.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xCheck this option if you would like to connect as a %c%lGuest Character%x rather than creating a new character for yourself.  This option is useful if your Internet site has been banned from creating new characters (Due to abuse.)


%c%l%$Your preferred name.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xEnter your preferred name for your new character.  This must be %y%l4%x or more letters in length (Maximum of %y%l20%x.)  You can also use %c%lspaces%x (' '), %c%lnumbers%x and %c%lunderscores%x ('%g%l_%x') in your name.

%c%lE.g:  %g%lFred Bloggs

%PAGE

%c%l%$Password.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~
%xEnter a password for your new character (%y%l6%x or more letters or numbers) that you will use in future to connect your character.  This should be something that others will not be able to easily guess to prevent unauthorised/malicious use of your character.

%c%lE.g:  %g%lxfjemcks   %r%l%f(IMPORTANT:  PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR PASSWORD!!!)

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xYour password is %y%lcase-sensitive%x (If you have trouble connecting in future, check that %g%lCAPS-LOCK%x isn't on.)  You can change your password to something else by typing '%g%l%(@password%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@password%>%x') at any time while connected to %@%m.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Verify password.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xType your password in again, %c%l%uexactly%x as you typed it the first time.  This is to ensure that you have entered it correctly, so that you will be able to connect your character the next time you want to use %@%m.

%c%lE.g:  %g%lxfjemcks   %r%l%f(IMPORTANT:  PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR PASSWORD!!!)


%c%l%$Gender.
%~%c~~~~~~~
%xChoose the gender (Sex) of your character from the three available options:  %y%lMale%x, %y%lFemale%x or %y%lNeuter%x.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xPlease be honest when choosing your gender.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Disclaimer.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~
%xPlease read this %r%lcarefully%x, and then check the box below it if you accept its terms and conditions, which your usage of %@%m is subject to.


%c%l%$Your character's race.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xEnter a race for your character.

%c%lE.g:  %g%lHuman%x, %g%lAlien%x, etc.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Your full E-mail address.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xEnter your %r%lFULL%x and %m%lvalid%x E-mail address.  This is required to ensure that you are a %r%lgenuine%x new user, and to allow Admin. to contact you should the need arises.

%c%lE.g:  %g%lFred.Bloggs@email.com

%xIf you wish to obtain %(Builder%) privileges to build your %(rooms%) and areas, you will need a valid private E-mail address ('Free' E-mail addresses from %c%lHotmail%x and similar services are not acceptable, because these can be obtained anonymously by anybody.)

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xYour E-mail address will be kept %r%lstrictly private and confidential%x unless you choose to make it public.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Time difference.
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf you live in a different %y%ltime zone%x from that of %@%m (%c%l%@%z%x), you should enter your time difference here, in hours.

%c%lE.g:  %g%l3    %c(%y%l3%x %c%lhours ahead of time shown.%c)
      %7%g%l-5   %c(%y%l5%x %c%lhours behind time shown.%c)


%xBefore creating your new character, you should check the %y%lWorld Wide Web Interface Preferences%x at the bottom of the form (See the earlier section on %c%lConnecting through the World Wide Web Interface%x for full details of these options.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$How to use the World Wide Web Interface...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xWhen you connect to %@%m through the World Wide Web Interface, your browser screen will split into two windows:  A small input window (Small lower section), into which you type your commands to %@%m, and a large output window (Large upper section), where you will see output resulting from your commands and activity of other users.


%c%l%$The input window
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe small lower section is where you type your commands to %@%m (This is mainly refered to as the '%c%lcommand-line%x'.)  In addition to sending commands to %@%m, a number of buttons are also provided, which perform several useful functions (These are described in more detail further on in this text.)

%PAGE
Unlike most standard Telnet software, you can fully edit the text you type by using the cursor keys to move along the line.  This means you can easily correct typing mistakes.  You can also recall the last command you typed and edit it by clicking on the %y%lRECALL%x button.

You don't need to click on the %y%lSEND%x button every time you type a command (Unless you prefer to do this)  -  Simply type your command and then press %c%lRETURN%x or %c%lENTER%x to send it to %@%m.

To speak to other users in the same room as you, you usually need to type '%g%l%(say%)%x' (See '%g%l%<say%>%x') in front of your message.  However, if you click on the %y%l%(CONVERSE%)%x button, so that the text in it changes from %r%lred%x to %g%lgreen%x (Indicating that it is switched on), you can just type your message and it will automatically be spoken to other users in the room.  To enter commands again, simply click on the %y%l%(CONVERSE%)%x button again to switch it off.  Alternatively, you can simply type a '%g%l.%x' in front of your command, i.e:  '%g%l.help html%x'.

%PAGE
The %y%lHELP%x and %y%lTUTORIAL%x buttons will call up the On-line Help and Tutorial systems respectively.  When you click on these buttons, a new browser window will open (So that your connection to %@%m isn't interrupted), in which you can browse the On-line Help and Tutorials.  If you have a printer connected to your computer, you can also print out the On-line Help and Tutorial pages.

The %y%l%(USERLIST%)%x button will open a new browser window and display a list of currently connected users, in the same format as the '%g%l%(who%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<who%>%x'.)  This window will automatically refresh itself every %y%l30%x seconds if left open.

The %y%lLOGOUT%x button is used to disconnect your character from %@%m and close your connection (Alternatively, you can type '%g%l%(QUIT%)%x' on %@%m (See '%g%l%<QUIT%>%x'.))  Once you have finished using %@%m, and wish to log out, you should click on this button to close your connection and then exit your web browser (See below for why you need to do this.)

%PAGE
%9%4%c%lIMPORTANT:  %r%l%f%uALWAYS%x completely exit your web browser after you have finished using %@%m (If you still need to use it, you can easily run it again.)  If you fail to do this, somebody else could come along (Especially if you are using a computer which is publicly accessible, such as a library or university computer room) and click on the %y%lBACK%x button to get back to the connect form and connect as your character.

            %9%4Please %m%lDON'T%x click on the %y%lSTOP%x button or close your browser without logging out of %@%m first, because this will leave your character still connected for %c%l5 minutes%x (%@%m thinks that you've lost your connection, so keeps your character connected to give you time to reconnect and resume it again (This can be done by either reloading the page or using the connect form to reconnect.)

%PAGE

%|%h<A NAME="OutputWindow">%h%|%c%l%$The output window
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe large upper section is where output from %@%m will be displayed (Such as descriptions of rooms you enter, speech/actions from other users, etc.)

This window stays connected to %@%m, so that you get output as and when it occurs without needing to reload the page.  As the output is effectively like downloading an infinitely sized web page, you may need to click on %y%lRELOAD%x from time to time to clear the output and free up the memory of your computer.  How often you need to do this depends on how much memory and hard disk space your computer has, and the quantity of output you receive.

If you are on slow Internet connection (Low speed modem) or your computer doesn't have much memory (I.e:  Less than 8Mb), it's advisable to turn off downloading of images in your browser (This can be found in the browser's menus.)

%PAGE
If your web browser supports %c%lJAVA script%x, you can have it automatically scroll the output window for you each time activity occurs in it.  If not, you will need to scroll it yourself manually.  For more information, please see the earlier section entitled '%y%lEnable JAVA Script enhancements%x'.

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^Please ensure you are attempting to connect to %@%m through the proper official web pages, which can be found at:  %9%3%b%l%u%{@?link "" "{%@%w}" "{%@%n}'s Web Site"}

%9%3%r%l%uPROBLEM:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^   %^Attempting to connect gives a page saying '%y%lSorry, your browser doesn't support frames...%x'

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^%@%m's World Wide Web Interface requires a browser capable of supporting %c%lframes%x, %c%lfill-in forms%x and %c%ltables%x at minimum.  Many older browsers do not support these features.  You will need to download a more recent browser, such as %y%lNetscape Navigator%x or %y%lMicrosoft Internet Explorer%x (Ideally %c%lversion 4.0%x or better of either.)

%PAGE
%9%3%r%l%uPROBLEM:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^   %^%@%m ignores or doesn't respond to any of the commands I type in the input window ('%y%l%@%m command:%x'), although I am connected and the output window is still updating.

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^The input window isn't connected to %@%m properly.  To solve this problem, simply click on your browser's %y%lRELOAD%x button to reload the page.

%9%3%r%l%uPROBLEM:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^   %^After sending a command to %@%m, I get '%y%lSorry, corrupt HTML data recieved...%x'

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^In rare cases, you may get the '%y%lSorry, corrupt HTML data recieved...%x' message in your input window after sending a command to %@%m.  This is a fault with some browsers and can be resolved simply by clicking on the browser's %y%lRELOAD%x button to reload the page.

%PAGE
%^           %^%9%3If this problem persists, try exiting your browser altogether and then starting it again.  If the problem still persists after that, you may need to download a more recent or different web browser (Preferably %y%lNetscape Navigator%x or %y%lMicrosoft Internet Explorer%x.)

%9%3%r%l%uPROBLEM:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^   %^The output window doesn't scroll automatically when new output occurs in it.

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^You need a web browser capable of supporting %c%lJAVA Script%x for the output window to scroll automatically whenever activity occurs in it.  For more information, please see the earlier section entitled '%y%l'Enable JAVA Script enhancements%x'.

%PAGE
%9%3%r%l%uPROBLEM:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^   %^The output window does not scroll all the way down to the bottom.

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^This is a common problem with the %c%lold JAVA scrolling%x method.  Ensure that you have a web browser installed that is capable of supporting %y%lJAVA Script 1.2%x (The latest versions of %y%lNetscape%x and %y%lMicrosoft Internet Explorer%x both do) and enable the %c%lnew JAVA scrolling%x method rather than the old one.

%9%3%r%l%uPROBLEM:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^   %^The World Wide Web Interface is extremely slow.

%9%3%g%l%uSOLUTION:%x%|%h<BR>%h%|%^  %^In order to use the World Wide Web Interface, you will ideally need a computer with a minimum of %y%l16Mb%x memory (%y%l64Mb%x or more recommended.)  Your computer should at least be equivalent to a %c%l486 PC%x (%y%lPentium%x or better recommended.)

%PAGE
%^           %^%9%3World Wide Web browsers, such as %y%lNetscape Navigator%x and %y%lMicrosoft Internet Explorer%x use a lot of memory, and can cause a lot of disk activity on computers with insufficient memory.

%^           %^%9%3If your computer is short on memory or has a slow processor, try closing down any other applications you have running first (With the exception of your Internet connection software.)

%^           %^%9%3The speed of your Internet connection also effects your connection through the World Wide Web Interface.  If you have a slow modem, or your Internet connection to %@%m is slow or poor, you will not be able to use the World Wide Web Interface.

%^           %^%9%3Either upgrade your modem (If it is the cause of the problem) or use Telnet (%c%lText-only%x) software to connect.

%PAGE
%^           %^%9%3If your computer is low on memory or your connection speed is slow, turning off loading of images in your web browser may help considerably, as these can be quite large in size, slowing down your connection and using up a lot of memory.

%^           %^%9%3A useful tip is to click on the %y%lRELOAD%x button every once in a while to clear the output window, which frees up the memory used by it.  The output window contains all the output (Including images) which occurred since you connected to %@%m or last clicked on the %y%lRELOAD%x button of your browser.%x

%r%l%f%$!IMPORTANT!   %m%l%$*****  Security considerations  *****   %r%l%f%$!IMPORTANT!
%~%r%f~~~~~~~~~~~   %m~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   %r%f~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf you are using the World Wide Web Interface on a computer which can or will be used by other people (Such as a %c%luniversity computer room%x, %c%llibrary%x or %c%lInternet Cafe%x), there are a number of precautions you will need to take to prevent somebody else from maliciously hacking into your %@%m character:

%PAGE

%c%lBSX graphics support%x was implemented in %y%lTCZ v3.4%x (See '%g%l%<implemented%>%x') as an experiment into adding a graphical user interface to TCZ.

Limited availability of client software (I.e:  None for Microsoft Windows at the time) and poor graphical capability lead to BSX support being dropped in %y%lTCZ v4.2%x in favour of the newly developed %c%lWorld Wide Web Interface%x (See '%g%l%<html%>%x'), which is vastly superiour and platform independant.

'%g%l~%x' is used mainly for testing query commands (Especially list/string/sentence processing queries, so you can see the resulting output.)  Placing a '%g%l~%x' in front of a command absorbs the output and then displays it to the screen (Rather than attempting to execute it as a command!)

%TITLE Help on '%w%l|%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l|<COMMAND>%]%x

Normally, when you type a command, %@%m searches up the area tree for a compound command of that name first, before testing to see if it's a built in command.  This means that if someone created a compound command with the same name as an internal command, that command would get executed instead of the internal command.

To get round this, type a vertical bar '%g%l|%x' followed by the command you want to execute.  This forces %@%m to ignore all compound commands of the same name (If they exist) and execute the command as an internal one.  If you can't get an internal command to work, or it doesn't do what it should, put a vertical bar in front of it.  Write down/remember the room you're in and the command you were trying to execute, and let a %c%lWizard/%cDruid%x or above know as soon as possible (Whoever created the command (If it's malicious) will have their %y%l%(BUILDER%)%x flag and building privileges removed from them.)

Administrators (%y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above) are there to help you with any problem or query you may have and also deal with abusive users.

%r%lExperienced Builders%x are ordinary users with exceptional building and compound command writing skills, who are a good choice if you have any building questions (Especially related to advanced building) and no %c%lWizard%x administrators are available.

%rAssistants%x are also ordinary users, who are prepared to give help to any user who needs it (Especially new users), however they may not necessarily have exceptional building skills (They are a good choice if you have any general questions or basic building questions and no %cDruid%x administrators are available.)

Retired administrators are past administrators who have retired from administrative duties.  Most will have good knowledge of %@%m, and will be more than willing to help you, if you ask.

This command puts you into AFK (%c%lAway From Keyboard%x (See '%g%l%<abbreviations%>%x')) mode.  To enter AFK mode, simply type '%g%lafk%x' followed by an AFK message, e.g:  '%g%lafk Getting something eat - back soon...%x', etc.  Once in AFK mode, you'll appear in the '%g%l%(who%)%x' list with the title '%y%lis AFK and idle%x' (Don't worry, your original title will return when you leave AFK mode) and people will get your AFK message if they try to '%g%l%(page%)%x'/'%g%l%(tell%)%x' messages to you.

To leave AFK mode, simply type in your character's password at the '%r%l[AFK]%x  Please enter your password:' prompt.

AFK mode is perfect when you're going to be AFK for a short period of time and don't want anyone to fiddle with your character.  However, even though no-one can do anything malicious with your character, someone could still exit your Telnet client and fiddle around in your user area.

%PAGE
%@%m also features an auto-AFK facility, which (By default) sends you AFK automatically when you idle for %c%l10%x or more minutes.  This time can be changed by typing '%g%lafk <TIME>%x', where %y%l<TIME>%x is the time in minutes.  The auto-AFK facility can also be turned off, by typing '%g%lafk off%x'.

Your new auto-AFK setting is not permanent.  However, you can place '%g%lafk%x' in your '%y%l.login%x' compound command (See '%g%l%<.login%>%x'), so that your AFK preference is set automatically when you connect to %@%m.

To ask for assistance, simply type '%g%lassist%x' followed by the reason you are asking for assistance/what you need assistance on, e.g:  '%g%lassist Can someone show me how to use the BBS%x', '%g%lassist Can someone help me with one of my compound commands?%x', etc.

Your request for assistance will be sent to %@%n's administrators  -  Usually, someone will be available to help you within a few minutes.  If you do not receive assistance after %c%l5 minutes%x or more, you can ask again by typing '%g%lassist%x' followed by your reason (As detailed above.)

%PAGE
%r%lExperienced Builders/%rAssistants%x and above can use '%g%lassist list%x' to display a list of users who need assistance  -  You can give assistance to one of these users by typing '%g%lassist <NAME>%x', or give assistance to the first user in the list by typing '%g%lassist%x' on its own.

%8%c%lNOTE:  %r%lExpererienced Builders/%rAssistants%x above can give assistance to users who have not received a response for over %c%l2 minutes%x, or when there are %c%l3%x or less %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above connected.

Giving assistance to a user will teleport you to their current location and let them know that you are available to help them.  Alternatively, you can give your %y%l<RESPONSE>%x ('%g%lassist <NAME> = <RESPONSE>%x'), which will be sent to them without teleporting you to their current location (Ideal for dealing with requests for assistance which can be answered with a single message.)

%TITLE Help on %w%lBuilding Quotas%x and %w%lBuilding Quota limits%x
All Builders start off with a Building Quota of %y%l100%x.  If you reach or exceed this limit, you will not be able to build any further objects.  You can see how much quota you have in use, and your current Building Quota limit by typing '%g%l%(scan%) me%x' (See '%g%l%<scan%>%x'), and see a summary of Building Quota in use by typing '%g%l%(@quota%)%x'.  If you run out of Building Quota, you should...

%6%g%l(1)  %xUsing '%g%l%(@list%)%x' list the different objects you have, and go through them looking for any unnecessary or useless objects (You more than likely have a few objects lying around that you no-longer need.)  Destroy any unnecessary or useless objects you have  -  This will reduce the amount of Building Quota you have in use.

%6%g%l(2)  %xIf you can't find anything you can destroy, get in touch with an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above and ask them to raise your Building Quota limit.

%PAGE
To obtain a Building Quota limit of more than %c%l500%x, you need to be building something which is beneficial to users other than just yourself and perhaps a few friends (E.g:  Spending all your Building Quota on a house for yourself (And possibly a few of your friends) doesn't warrant a Building Quota greater than 500.)

All rooms and objects should be well described with no spelling/typing mistakes (Use a dictionary to check), the area must consist of more than just rooms, things and exits (I.e:  A good number of useful and fully working compound commands which bring the area and objects in it to life) and all exits in the area should have success ('%g%l%(@succ%)%x'), drop ('%g%l%(@drop%)%x') and others drop ('%g%l%(@odrop%)%x') messages set.  Ideally, the exits should also be set %y%l%(OPAQUE%)%x (So you don't get the default '%c%lleads to <DESTINATION>%x' added to the name of the exit.)  Every room should also have at least one exit with the names '%g%lout;exit;back;leave%x' in it's name(s) (These are the standard commands for leaving a room.)

%PAGE
You should not have any redundant objects lying around from previous building projects which you've abandoned, or from the days when you were learning to build.  If you do, you should destroy them and re-use the Building Quota they were using.

%TITLE Help on object creation and last usage times/dates
Every object in %@%n has a date stamp, which records the date and time when the object was created and the time and date when it was last used.

You can view the date stamps of an object by examining it using either the '%g%l%(examine%)%x' (See '%g%l%<examine%>%x') or '%g%l%(settings%)%x' (See '%g%l%<settings%>%x') commands.

The '%g%l%(@list%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@list%>%x') and '%g%l%(@find%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@find%>%x') commands can be used to list/search for objects based on their creation and/or last usage date.

The last usage time/date of an object is updated everytime its text fields (I.e:  '%g%l%(@desc%)%x', '%g%l%(@succ%)%x', '%g%l%(@fail%)%x', etc.) or its lock are accessed/modified (%c%lNOTE:  %xExamining an object or scanning a character does not update the last usage time/date.)

%PAGE
%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xAny objects/characters in the database created before TCZ v4.1 will have the same creation and last usage time/date as when TCZ was upgraded to version 4.1, because versions of TCZ prior to v4.1 did not record the time and date when objects were created/last used.

The date/time must be given in the following order:  %y%l<DAY> <MONTH> <YEAR> <HOUR> <MINUTE> <SECOND>%x, e.g:  The date '%y%lTuesday 11th June 1996, 3:10.21 pm%x' could also be specified in the following formats:  '%y%l11 June 1996, 3:10.21pm%x', '%y%l11/6/1996 - 15:10.21%x', '%y%lMon 11 Jun 1996; 3-10-21pm%x', etc.  The time may optionally be omitted (%c%l12:00.00 am%x will be assumed if the time is omitted.)

%PAGE
If '%y%llongdate%x' is specified, the converted date will be returned in the %c%lLONGDATE%x date format, otherwise it will be returned in %c%lEPOCH%x date/time format.  Please see '%g%l%<epoch%>%x' and '%g%l%<longdate%>%x' for more information on the %c%lEPOCH%x and %c%lLONGDATE%x date/time formats.

If '%y%ldate%x' is specified, %y%l<DATE>%x will be converted as a date only, otherwise if '%y%ltime%x' is specified, %y%l<DATE>%x will be converted as a time only.  If neither are specified, %y%l<DATE>%x will be converted as date and time.

Returns the description of %y%l<OBJECT>%x.

'%g%l{@?desc}%x' can also be used to return the description (Or contents if you like) of a dynamic array element (Or a range of elements), e.g:  '%g%l{@?desc myarray[2]}%x' returns the description of the %c%l2nd%x element of the dynamic array '%y%lmyarray%x' and '%g%l{@?desc myarray[test]}%x' returns the description of the element with the index name '%y%ltest%x' of '%y%lmyarray%x'.

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@damage%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@damage <NAME> = <ACCURACY> <MIN DAMAGE> <MAX DAMAGE> <DELAY> <SCORE>%]%x


This command can only be used from within a compound command with its %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<combat flag%>%x'), in a location which also has its %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set.  Both must be owned by the same character.

'%g%l@damage%x' attempts to damage the character %y%l<NAME>%x.  Whether it succeeds or not is determined by %y%l<ACCURACY>%x, which is a percentage (Out of %c%l100%x.)  The lower this percentage, the more likely '%g%l@damage%x' will fail and return '%c%lMISS%x'.

If '%g%l@damage%x' succeeds, the victim will lose a random amount of health between %y%l<MIN DAMAGE>%x and %y%l<MAX DAMAGE>%x.  If the victim survives, '%g%l@damage%x' will succeed and return '%c%lHIT%x', otherwise the attacker will be awarded %y%l<SCORE>%x points, the victim will lose 2/3rds of %y%l<SCORE>%x from their current score and '%g%l@damage%x' will succeed and return '%c%lKILL%x'.

%PAGE
Whether '%g%l@damage%x' is successful or not, the attacker will not be able to fight again (I.e:  Use '%g%l@damage%x') for %y%l<DELAY>%x seconds.  When a character is still subject to a combat delay, '%g%l@damage%x' returns '%c%lDELAY%x'.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %x'%g%l@damage%x' cannot be used on yourself if you own the compound command or location in which it is used, or the character %y%l<NAME>%x is not in the same location as you.  These restrictions can be removed by setting %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x or %y%l%(ELDER%)%x flags on the combat commands respectively (See '%g%l%<wizard flag%>%x' and '%g%l%<elder flag%>%x'.)

       %8Score is not awarded unless an %y%l%(APPRENTICE%)%x, %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x or %y%l%(ELDER%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<apprentice flag%>%x', '%g%l%<wizard flag%>%x' and '%g%l%<elder flag%>%x') is set on the compound command containing the '%g%l@damage%x' command.

       %8Battles won, lost and score %c%lare not%x updated if you are the owner of the compound command containing the '%g%l@damage%x' command.  This is to prevent the owner of a combat area from cheating to improve their performance or score.

%PAGE
       %8Combat can only take place in locations which have their %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set and do not have their %y%l%(HAVEN%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<combat flag%>%x' and '%g%l%<haven flag%>%x'.)

Some of the parameters of '%g%l@damage%x' may be subject to restrictions, depending on flags set on the compound command(s):

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@delay%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@delay <NAME> = [+/-]<TIME>%]%x

This command can only be used from within a compound command with its %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<combat flag%>%x'), in a location which also has its %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set.  Both must be owned by the same character.

'%g%l@delay%x' increases (Or decreases, if a negative %y%l<TIME>%x is specified) the character %y%l<NAME>%x's combat delay by %y%l<TIME>%x seconds, and is ideal for creating 'stun' weapons, e.g:  '%g%l@delay *fred = 10%x' will increase the character "%c%lFred%x"'s combat delay by %y%l10 seconds%x.

A character subject to a combat delay can't fight again (I.e:  Use '%g%l%(@damage%)%x') until the time of their delay has passed.

%PAGE
%c%l%8NOTE:  %x'%g%l@delay%x' cannot be used on yourself if you own the compound command or location in which it is used, or the character %y%l<NAME>%x is not in the same location as you.  These restrictions can be removed by setting %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x or %y%l%(ELDER%)%x flags on the combat commands respectively (See '%g%l%<wizard flag%>%x' and '%g%l%<elder flag%>%x'.)

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@foreach [<GRP/RANGE>] "<SEPARATOR>" "<LIST>" do [<COMMAND>]
                 [<COMMANDS>]
        [@end]%]%x

The '%g%l@foreach%x' command can be used in two forms:  The first form may only be used on a %c%lSINGLE LINE%x.  '%g%l@foreach%x' is used to process the items in a list (In left to right order), executing %y%l<COMMAND>%x for each item processed.

%y%l<SEPARATOR>%x is the string used to separate the items in the list from each other.

%[%c%lExample:  %g%l@foreach ";" "eggs;bacon;sausage;chips;mushrooms" do @echo Item:  $6%]%x

%PAGE
The reserved variables %y%l$4%x, %y%l$5%x and %y%l$6%x are useful in an '%g%l@foreach%x' statement  -  These substitute the following...

%4%y%l$4 %xsubstitutes the current item number in the list being processed (Most useful when using grouping/range operators with '%g%l@foreach%x'.)
%4%y%l$5 %xsubstitutes the total number of items processed so far.
%4%y%l$6 %xsubstitutes the item in the list currently being processed.

%8%c%lNOTE:  %x'%g%l@foreach%x' can only be used from within compound commands (Unless you're an %r%lExperienced Builder%x or above.)

The second form of '%g%l@foreach%x' allows you to execute a 'block' of commands.

When using '%g%l@foreach%x' in this form, it %c%lMUST%x be spread over multiple lines and terminated with '%g%l%(@end%)%x'.  '%g%l@foreach%x' and '%g%l%(@end%)%x' %c%lMUST NOT%x be preceeded by any text other than blank space, or used within %y%l{}%x's (I.e:  '%g%l{@foreach ...}%x'.)  The '%y%ldo%x' keyword %c%lMUST NOT%x be followed with a %y%l<COMMAND>%x.

%PAGE
The usage of '%g%l@foreach%x' in this form is identical to the single lined version of '%g%l@foreach%x', except it is spread over multiple lines, e.g:

%[%g%l@foreach ";" "eggs;bacon;sausage;chips;mushrooms" do
         %(@echo%) Item:  $6
         %(@echo%) Item number:  $4
@end%]%x

%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xYou can 'nest' further '%g%l%(@if%)%x', '%g%l%(@case%)%x', '%g%l%(@for%)%x', '%g%l%(@with%)%x', '%g%l%(@while%)%x' and '%g%l%(@foreach%)%x' statements (Both single and multiple lined) within a multiple line '%g%l@foreach%x' statement.

%PAGE

%c%l%$[<GRP/RANGE>]
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xGrouping/range operators may optionally be used with '%g%l@foreach%x' to process a given page or range of items in a list.  For example, you can process the %c%lfirst page%x of items in a list using '%g%l@foreach 1:default <SEPARATOR> <LIST> do ...%x' or process the %c%l2nd%x to %c%l5th%x items in a list using '%g%l@foreach 2-5 <SEPARATOR> <LIST> do ...%x'

If a range of elements is specified, the descriptions of these elements will be returned, separated by %c%lNEWLINE%x's, e.g:  '%g%l{@?elementno myarray[4..7]}%x' will return the descriptions of elements %c%l4%x, %c%l5%x, %c%l6%x and %c%l7%x of the dynamic array '%y%lmyarray%x'.

Returns the specified E-mail address of the character %y%l<NAME>%x (Or your specified E-mail address, if %y%l<NAME>%x is omitted.)  If the second parameter is omitted, the user's private E-mail address will be returned by default.

If '%y%lpublic%x' is specified, the user's first public E-mail address will be returned.  Likewise, '%y%lprivate%x' will return the user's private E-mail address (You must have 'write' permission or be an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above to query the private E-mail address of another character.)

The user's other public E-mail addresses can be returned by giving a %y%l<NUMBER>%x between %c%l3%x and %c%l5%x.

%PAGE
Specifying '%y%lall%x' will return all of the user's E-mail addresses, separated by NEWLINE's (For Mortals, the private E-mail address (%c%l2%x) will be blanked in the returned list of E-mail addresses.)  You can process this list by using list processing query commands (See '%g%l%<advanced queries%>%x'), using '%g%l{%(@?newline%)}%x' as the separator (See '%g%l%<@?newline%>%x'.)

Fails and returns '%c%lError%x' if the character %y%l<NAME>%x can't be found or the specified E-mail address isn't currently set.

%TOPIC @?img
%TOPIC @?image
%TITLE Help on '%w%l@?image%x'
%c%l%[USAGE:  %g%l{@?image "<IMAGE URL>" "<DESCRIPTION>" ["<DESTINATION URL>"]}%]%x

Inserts a properly formatted HTML image and an optional link to a web site (When the image is clicked on.)  The link is opened a new browser window so that it doesn't interfere with the connection of a user using the World Wide Web Interface.

%y%l<IMAGE URL>%x is the URL of the image, e.g:  %b%l%u%@%wimages/tczlogo3.gif%x

%y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x is a text description of the image, which will be seen by users who have images switched off, or are using a text-only browser.

%y%l<DESTINATION URL>%x is the URL of an optional web site link for when the image is clicked on by the user, e.g:  %b%l%u%@%w%x

%PAGE
The best way to insert an image into a description is using query substition, i.e:  '%g%l%%{@?image ...}%x' (%c%lNOTE:  %xIf you type this on the command-line, you will need to protect the opening '%g%l{%x' with '%g%l\%x' to prevent it from being evaluated.)

%9%4%c%lIMPORTANT:  %xIf you do not use query substitution, the HTML part of the link will be 'hard' substituted and will be difficult to edit or remove without deleting the entire line.


%c%l%$Example:
%~%c~~~~~~~~
%g%l%(@desc%) me = %%\{@?image "%@%wimages/tczlogo3.gif" "TCZ City Picture" "%@%w"}%x

Inserts %y%l<ITEM>%x %c%lIN FRONT%x of item number %y%l<NUMBER>%x in the list %y%l<LIST>%x.  If %y%l<NUMBER>%x doesn't exist (E.g:  List with 4 items and you specify 9 as %y%l<NUMBER>%x), %y%l<ITEM>%x will be added to the end of the list.  %y%l<SEPARATOR>%x is the string used to separate the items in the list from each other.

If you use the word '%y%lLAST%x' instead of specifing a number for %y%l<NUMBER>%x, it inserts %y%l<ITEM>%x in front of the last item in the list.  Using the word '%y%lFIRST%x' inserts %y%l<ITEM>%x in front of the first item in the list.

%PAGE
The word '%y%lEND%x' can also be used with '%g%l{@?insert}%x' (But not with any of the other list processing queries)  -  This adds %y%l<ITEM>%x to the end of the list.

%c%l%[USAGE:  %g%l{@?link "<NAME>" "<DESTINATION>" ["<HELPTEXT>"]}%]%x

Inserts a properly formatted HTML link to a web site or any other suitable URL recognised by web browsers.  The link is opened a new browser window so that it doesn't interfere with the connection of a user using the World Wide Web Interface.

%y%l<NAME>%x is the name of the link, which will appear on-screen for the user to click on.

%y%l<DESTINATION>%x is the destination URL of the link, for example:  %b%l%u%{@?link "" "{%@%w}" "@?link example"}%x

%y%l<HELPTEXT>%x is optional quick help text that will be displayed in recent browsers if the user holds their mouse pointer still over the link.

%PAGE
The best way to insert a link into a description is using query substition, i.e:  '%g%l%%{@?link ...}%x' (%c%lNOTE:  %xIf you type this on the command-line, you will need to protect the opening '%g%l{%x' with '%g%l\%x' to prevent it from being evaluated.)

%9%4%c%lIMPORTANT:  %xIf you do not use query substitution, the HTML part of the link will be 'hard' substituted and will be difficult to edit or remove without deleting the entire line.


%c%l%$Example:
%~%c~~~~~~~~
%g%l%(@desc%) me = Visit %@%m's web site by clicking %%\{@?link "HERE" "%@%w" "Click to visit %@%m's Web Site..."}.%x

'%g%l{@?match}%x' calls %@%m's standard hierarchical object matching routines to match for the object %y%l<OBJECT NAME>%x.  If found, the object's name (Or #ID if you have read or write permission) is returned.  Otherwise, '%y%lError%x' is returned.

With the exception of internal commands which can be used to refer to characters only, all internal commands which refer to objects use the hierarchical object matching routines in one way or another.

%PAGE
For details on specifying %y%l<OBJECT NAME>%x, see '%g%l%<matching%>%x'.

%y%l<PREFERRED TYPES>%x specifies one or more optional preferred object types to match against.  Preferred object types are matched first, followed by any remaining non-preferred types.  By default, the preferred object type is '%y%lthings%x' (This is the case for many internal %@%m commands which use matching.)  For example, '%g%l{@?match <OBJECT NAME> = characters}%x' will match against all object types, giving %c%lcharacters%x priority.

%PAGE
%c%l%8NOTE:  %xRather than using '%g%l{@?myleaf}%x' without parameters to get the effective location of a compound command, you can use the matching keyword '%y%lmyleaf%x'.  This gives exactly the same result with the added benefit of being easier to use, more readable and more efficient.

       The '%y%lmyleaf%x' matching keyword is used in the example below (Which shows you how to take advantage of '%y%lmyleaf%x' within inherited compound commands.  Replacing '%y%lmyleaf%x' with '%g%l{@?myleaf}%x' will give exactly the same results.

%c%l%$Example use of '%w%l%$myleaf%c%l%$'...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xSay you wanted to create a number of guns, each which can be 'shot' by typing '%g%lshoot%x'.  This can be done easily using inheritance and '%g%lmyleaf%x':

Firstly, create the first gun, which will act as the parent object, e.g:  '%g%l%(@thing%) Shotgun = A large, double-barrelled shotgun.%x' (See '%g%l%<@thing%>%x'.)

Next, create the '%g%lshoot%x' compound command:  

%[   %g%l%(edit%) command desc shoot;fire
   %(@echo%) %%g%%lYou aim the %%y%%l{%(@?name%) myleaf}%%g%%l at %%w%%l%3%%g%%l and pull the
         trigger %%c- %%r%%l%%f*BANG*%%x
   %(@oemote%) %%g%%laims %%p %%y%%l{%(@?name%) myleaf}%%g%%l at %%w%%l$3%%g%%l and pulls the
         trigger %%c- %%r%%l%%f*BANG*%%x
   %(.exit%)%]%x

%PAGE
...Now teleport the '%g%lshoot%x' compound command to the shotgun by typing '%g%l%(@tel%) shoot = shotgun%x'.  You can now create further guns simply by creating an object with the appropriate name and description and setting its parent to the shotgun using '%g%l%(@parent%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@parent%>%x'), e.g:

   %[%g%l%(@thing%) Pistol = A small automatic pistol.
   %(@parent%) pistol = shotgun%]%x

...Now drop the shotgun.  When you type '%g%lshoot <NAME>%x', you'll get '%y%lYou aim the Pistol at <NAME>...%x'  If you drop the pistol and pick up the shotgun again and type '%g%lshoot <NAME>%x', you'll get '%y%lYou aim the Shotgun at <NAME>...%x'

You should not force a specific date format, because other users from other countries may not use or understand the same date format as you.  '%g%l{@?realtime}%x' used without %y%l<FORMAT>%x will display the date/time in the preferred format choosen by the user.

For information on how to set your preferred time and date formats, please see '%g%l%<@dateformat%>%x'.  The same format codes can also be specified for %y%l<FORMAT>%x.

%TITLE Help on the %w%lLONGDATE%x date format
The %c%lLONGDATE%x format is a flexible date format used by %@%m to represent any date between %y%l1st January 0001%x and %y%l31st December 9999%x.  Unlike the %c%lEPOCH%x (See '%g%l%<epoch%>%x') format, the %c%lLONGDATE%x format cannot represent time, however it can support a considerably greater range of dates than the %c%lEPOCH%x format (For example, it's used internally to represent each character's date of birth (See '%g%l%<@profile%>%x'.))

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xTCZ is %y%lYear 2000%x complient (Y2K) because all dates stored internally use either the %c%lEPOCH%x or %c%lLONGDATE%x format.

Inserts a properly formatted HTML link which will allow users of the World Wide Web Interface to execute a compound command simply by clicking on the link.

%y%l<NAME>%x is the name of the link, which will appear on-screen for the user to click on.

%y%l<COMMAND>%x is a compound command (See '%g%l%<@command%>%x') to execute when the link is clicked on, just as though the user had typed it at the command-line.

%r%lTo prevent abuse, only compound commands can be executed using '%y%l{@?tczlink}%r%l'.%x

%PAGE
%y%l<HELPTEXT>%x is optional quick help text that will be displayed in recent browsers if the user holds their mouse pointer still over the link.

%y%l<IMAGE URL>%x is an optional image, which will be used instead of a hyperlink (The user clicks on the image to execute the compound command.)

%8%c%lNOTE:%x  %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x must also be specified, if %y%l<IMAGE URL>%x is used.
       %8%y%l<NAME>%x is not used (You can specify %g%l""%x for this if you wish.)

%y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x is a text description of the image (If %y%l<IMAGE URL>%x is specified), which will be seen by users who have images switched off, or are using a text-only browser.

%PAGE
The best way to insert a compound command link into a description is using query substition, i.e:  '%g%l%%{@?tczlink ...}%x' (%c%lNOTE:  %xIf you type this on the command-line, you will need to protect the opening '%g%l{%x' with '%g%l\%x' to prevent it from being evaluated.)

%9%4%c%lIMPORTANT:  %xIf you do not use query substitution, the HTML part of the link will be 'hard' substituted and will be difficult to edit or remove without deleting the entire line.

%[%c%lFORMAT:  %g%l<GROUP NO>:<GROUP SIZE>%]%x

When you type '%g%l%(who%) 1%x', '%g%l%(who%) 2%x' to page the '%g%l%(who%)%x' list, etc., you're using a powerful feature of %@%n  -  A grouping operator.  A grouping operator basically splits a list of items into groups of %y%l12%x (The default, which is determined from your current set screen height (See '%g%l%<set screenheight%>%x'.))

%y%l<GROUP SIZE>%x (As explained above) is the size of each group in list items  -  If %y%l<GROUP SIZE>%x or the '%y%l:%x' are omitted, the default group size is assumed.  %y%l<GROUP NO>%x is which group of list items you'd like to display/access, e.g:  '%g%l%(who%) 1:5%x' displays the first group of %c%l5 characters%x in the '%g%l%(who%)%x' list.  If %y%l<GROUP NO>%x is ommitted (The '%y%l:%x' %c%lMUST%x be included if you do this, e.g:  '%g%l%(who%) :5%x') or the keyword '%y%lDEFAULT%x' is used, the last %c%lFULL%x group of items is displayed (I.e:  In this case, the last %c%l5 characters%x in the '%g%l%(who%)%x' list will be displayed.)

%PAGE
You can also use the keywords '%y%lFIRST%x', '%y%lLAST%x', '%y%lDEFAULT%x' and '%y%lALL%x' (%c%lNOTE:%x  You don't have to type them in capitals!) for both %y%l<GROUP SIZE>%x and %y%l<GROUP NO>%x.

Grouping operators can be used in all %@%m commands that produce lists  -  These include:  '%g%l%(who%)%x', '%g%l%(swho%)%x', '%g%l%(lwho%)%x', '%g%l%(where%)%x', '%g%l%(emaillist%)%x', '%g%l%(hosts%)%x', '%g%l%(last%)%x', '%g%l%(chat%) who%x', '%g%l%(@list%)%x', '%g%l%(@find%)%x', '%g%l%(@entrances%)%x', '%g%l%(@with%)%x', etc.

A grouping operator %c%lMUST%x be declared before the first parameter given to any of the above commands (E.g:  '%g%l%(@list%) 1 me = things%x' is OK, '%g%l%(@list%) me = 1 things%x' isn't.)

%[%c%lFORMAT:  %g%l<FROM ITEM>-<TO ITEM>
         <FROM ITEM>..<TO ITEM>%]%x

Range operators are most useful to Builders.  They allow you to display/access a range of items in a list (E.g:  The contents list of a room or the characters in the '%g%l%(who%)%x' list), e.g:  '%g%l%(@command%) rangetest = @with 2-5 contents here do @echolist $4 = {@?name $6}%x'  -  Executing this command would list the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th items in the contents list of the room you're currently in.

%y%l<FROM ITEM>%x is the item number the range starts from and %y%l<TO ITEM>%x is the item number the range finishes at.  You can either use a '%y%l-%x' or '%y%l..%x' to separate %y%l<FROM ITEM>%x and %y%l<TO ITEM>%x (the choice is yours!)  Items are processed in %c%lASCENDING ORDER%x so make sure %y%l<FROM ITEM>%x is less than, or equal to %y%l<TO ITEM>%x, otherwise no items will be processed.

%PAGE
As with grouping operators, you can use the keywords '%y%lFIRST%x', '%y%lLAST%x', '%y%lDEFAULT%x' and '%y%lALL%x' (%c%lNOTE:%x  You don't have to type them in capitals!) for both %y%l<FROM ITEM>%x and %y%l<TO ITEM>%x.

You can use a range operator %c%lAND%x a grouping operator together if you like, however the range operator will be processed first, and then the grouping operator (Meaning the range will be split up into groups rather than the whole item list.)

%8%c%lHINT:%x  You can use a range operator to return any given item number in a list of items (When using '%g%l%(@with%)%x') by using '%y%l<ITEM NO>-<ITEM NO>%x' as your range operator, e.g:  '%g%l%(@with%) 2-2 contents here do...%x' gets the %y%l2nd item%x in the contents list of the room you're in.

%PAGE
Range operators can be used in all %@%m commands that produce lists  -  These include:  '%g%l%(who%)%x', '%g%l%(swho%)%x', '%g%l%(lwho%)%x', '%g%l%(where%)%x', '%g%l%(emaillist%)%x', '%g%l%(hosts%)%x', '%g%l%(last%)%x', '%g%l%(chat%) who%x', '%g%l%(@list%)%x', '%g%l%(@find%)%x', '%g%l%(@entrances%)%x', '%g%l%(@with%)%x', etc.

A range operator %c%lMUST%x be declared before the first parameter given to any of the above commands (E.g:  '%g%l%(@list%) 2-5 me = things%x' is OK, '%g%l%(@list%) me = 2-5 things%x' isn't.)

Global aliases are matched after user-defined aliases, so a user can override a global alias if they wish to do so by defining an alias with the same name.

When set to '%y%lyes%x', unused characters and objects will be destroyed on a weekly basis.  Maintenance helps keep the database free of redundant characters and objects which will probably never be used again.

Any character or object which couldn't be destroyed by maintenance (E.g:  A Builder who has objects locked to them, an object used in the lock of another object, etc.) will have its %y%l%(ASHCAN%)%x flag set (You can use '%g%l%(@list%) all = ashcanned characters%x' or '%g%l%(@list%) all = ashcanned%x' to list them.)

%8%c%lNOTE:  %m%lDeities%x and the %m%lSupreme Being%x may use the '%g%l%(@maintenance%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@maintenance%>%x') command to manually start %y%lcharacter%x, %y%lobject%x, %y%lmail%x or %y%lBBS%x maintenance.

        @alarm <NAME> = + <SECONDS> <MINUTES> <HOURS> <DAYS>%]%x

Alarms can only be created by %c%lWizards/%cDruids%x and above.  They allow the compound command linked by their '%g%l%(@csucc%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@csucc%>%x') to be executed automatically at certain time(s) during the week, or every given interval of time.

The first form causes the alarm to go off at the same time each week.

Days are numbered from %y%l1 - 7%x, with day 1 being Monday.  If you enter a '%y%l*%x' in any field instead of a number, the alarm will execute regardless of the value of that field, e.g:  '%g%l0 0 12 *%x' would cause the alarm to go off at midday every day.

The second form causes the alarm to go off every given interval of time, e.g: '%g%l+ 0 10 0 0%x' would cause the alarm to execute every 10 minutes and '%g%l+ 0 0 2 0%x' would cause the alarm to execute every 2 hours. 

%PAGE
You can disable an alarm (Without destroying it), by either resetting its description or csuccess branch ('%g%l%(@csucc%)%x'.)

%9%2%r%lWARNING:  %xAlarms are restricted to %c%lWizards/%cDruids%x and above due to the potential CPU usage and lag they could cause if used incorrectly.  Lots of alarms executing at regular intervals (I.e:  One or more times every 5 minutes) or straight after each other (Because their time of execution is the same) could cause lag and/or slow %@%m down  -  Especially if the compound commands being executed are relatively complex.

The '%g%l@alias%x' command is used to add or change aliases for %@%m commands.
'%g%l@unalias%x' is used to remove them.

Mortals may have up to %c%l100%x unique aliases, %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and %c%lWizards/%cDruids%x may have up to %c%l200%x, and %g%lElder Wizards/%gDruids%x and above are unrestricted.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Adding aliases...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
To add an alias, simply type '%g%l@alias <NAME> = <COMMAND>%x', e.g:  '%g%l@alias bye = %(say%) I'm off now - See ya later!%x' will add an alias '%y%lbye%x' which when typed as a command will make you say "%c%lI'm off now - See ya later!%x" to everyone in the same room.

Multiple aliases may be defined for a command, by specifying more than one name, e.g:  '%g%l@alias bye goodbye seeya = say I'm off now - See ya later!%x'  -  With this alias, you can type '%g%lbye%x', '%g%lgoodbye%x' or '%g%lseeya%x' to say "%y%lI'm off now - See ya later!%x" to everyone in the same room.

Aliases may also be given a parameter, which can be substituted into the alias using '%y%l!*%x', e.g:  '%g%l@alias %(say%) " ' ` = %(say%) %%r%%l!*%x' will alias the '%g%l%(say%)%x' command, so that you speak in colour (%r%lRed%x) everytime you use it.

%PAGE
'%g%l%(@mexec%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@mexec%>%x') can also be used with aliases, allowing you to use them as a %c%lcheap alternative%x to compound commands for performing small tasks, e.g:  '%g%l@alias toparea = %(@mexec%) \{:%%g%%lheads back to %%p Top Area.}\{%(@tel%) me = #12345}\{%(@echo%) %%g%%lYou head back to your Top Area.}%x' (%c%lNOTE:  %x'%y%l\%x's %c%lMUST%x be used in front of '%y%l{%x's on the command line to prevent them from being evaluated)  -  This alias will teleport you back to your Top Area (Replace %y%l#12345%x with the #ID of your Top Area.))


%c%l%$Changing aliases...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
To change an alias, simply type '%g%l@alias <NAME> = <NEW COMMAND>%x', e.g:  '%g%l@alias %(say%) = say %%g%%l!*%x' will change the alias for '%g%l%(say%)%x' so that you speak in %g%lgreen%x text rather than %r%lred%x.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Removing aliases...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x

%c%l%$Global aliases
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xAn alias may be made global, so that it applies to every character on %@%m, including from within compound commands.  To do this, the global aliases owner must be set by the %m%lSupreme Being%x using '%g%l%(@admin%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@admin%>%x'.)  All aliases of this character (When set) will be global.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@areawrite <MESSAGE>%]%x

'%g%l@areawrite%x' is similar to the '%g%l%(@write%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@write%>%x'), except that it displays %y%l<MESSAGE>%x in your current location, and all locations within that location.

You must own or have write permission to your current location to use '%g%l@areawrite%x'.  If there are locations owned by other users within the location, the message will be displayed in them, even if you don't have write permission.

Messages sent using '%g%l@areawrite%x' exclude your name, and will not be seen in locations set %y%lQUIET%x or by characters who have set their %y%lQUIET%x flag.

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@array%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@array <NAME> [= <INITIAL SIZE>]%]%x

Creates a dynamic array called %y%l<NAME>%x (Building Quota used:  %c%l1%x.)  If %y%l<INITIAL SIZE>%x is specified, the new dynamic array is given that number of blank elements (Providing you have sufficient Building Quota (Building Quota used by each element:  %c%l1%x.))

Dynamic arrays are similar to the arrays found in most high-level programming langauges such as Pascal, C, etc.  However, the main difference is that arrays in %@%m are %c%lDYNAMIC%x (I.e:  There's no limit to the the number of elements an array can have (Except your Building Quota limit), and the size of the array can easily be changed by inserting or destroying elements.)

%PAGE
Once a dynamic array has been created, its elements can be referenced either by %c%lnumber%x, %c%lindex name%x or one of the keywords '%y%lFIRST%x' (First element), '%y%lLAST%x' (Last element) or '%y%lEND%x' (Add new element to end of array) enclosed in square brackets after its name (E.g:  You could reference the %c%l2nd%x element of the dynamic array '%y%lmyarray%x' using '%g%lmyarray[2]%x' and reference the indexed element '%y%ltest%x' using '%g%lmyarray[test]%x'.)

You can also specify a range of elements by using '%y%l[<FROM>..<TO>]%x' or '%y%l[<FROM>-<TO>]%x', e.g:  You could reference elements %c%l4%x, %c%l5%x, %c%l6%x and %c%l7%x of '%y%lmyarray%x' by using either '%g%lmyarray[4..7]%x' or '%g%lmyarray[4-7]%x'.  Using ranges allows you to describe, destroy, etc. several elements at once.  You can use the keyword '%y%lALL%x' to reference every element of the dynamic array (This is the same as using '%y%l[FIRST..LAST]%x'), e.g:  You could reference every element of '%y%lmyarray%x' by using '%g%lmyarray[ALL]%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Describing and adding new elements...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can set the description of an element by using '%g%l%(@desc%) <ARRAY>[<ELEMENT>] [= <DESCRIPTION>]%x'  -  This sets the description of the given element(s) to %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x (Or clears the description of the given element(s) if %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x isn't specified.), e.g:  '%g%l%(@desc%) myarray[2] = element 2%x', '%g%l%(@desc%) myarray[test] = indexed element 'test'%x'.

If the element(s) being described do not exist, they'll be created (Building Quota used by each new element:  %c%l1%x.)  If the element being described is an element with an index name, and an element with that index name doesn't already exist, a new element will be added to the end of the dynamic array and given the specified index name and description.

You can easily add a new element to the end of a dynamic array using the '%y%lEND%x' keyword, e.g:  '%g%l%(@desc%) myarray[END] = a new element%x'.

For further information on describing and adding new elements, see '%g%l%<@desc%>%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Inserting a new element...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can insert a new element in front of any element of a dynamic array by using '%g%l%(@insert%) <ARRAY>[<ELEMENT>] [= <DESCRIPTION>%x'  -  This inserts a new element in front of element %y%l<ELEMENT>%x (Or if %y%l<ELEMENT>%x is a range, the new element will be inserted in front of the first element of the range) and sets its description to %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x (If %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x is specified), e.g:  '%g%l%(@insert%) myarray[2] = a new inserted element%x', '%g%l%(@insert%) myarray[test] = a new inserted element in front of indexed element 'test'%x'.

For further information on inserting new elements, see '%g%l%<@insert%>%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Destroying an element...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can destroy an element and remove it from a dynamic array by using '%g%l%(@destroy%) <ARRAY>[<ELEMENT>]%x'  -  This destroys the element %y%l<ELEMENT>%x (Or range of elements, if a range is specified), e.g:  '%g%l%(@dest%) myarray[2]%x', '%g%l%(@dest%) myarray[test]%x'.  An alternative to destroying an element is simply clearing its description (I.e:  If you purposely want the dynamic array to stay a fixed size.)

For further information on destroying elements, see '%g%l%<@destroy%>%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Returning the description of an element (Or range of elements)...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can get the description of an element (Or range of elements) by using the '%g%l{%(@?elementno%)}%x' query command, for example '%g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?elementno%) myarray[2]}%x' will display the description of the %c%l2nd%x element of '%y%lmyarray%x' and '%g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?elementno%) myarray[test]}%x' will display the description of the element with the index name '%y%ltest%x' of '%y%lmyarray%x'.

For further information on returning the description of an element, see '%g%l%<@?elementno%>%x'.


%c%l%$Processing the elements or index names of a dynamic array...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can process the elements or index names of a dynamic array (Or a range of specific elements) using the '%g%l%(@with%)%x' command.  For details on how to do this, see '%g%l%<@with%>%x'.  Example:  '%g%l%(@with%) elements myarray do %(@echo%) $6%x', '%g%l%(@with%) indexnames myarray do %(@echo%) $6%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Editing the elements of a dynamic array...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You can use %@%n's built-in editor to edit the elements of a dynamic array (However, you can only edit a single element at a time.)

To edit the elements of a dynamic array, simply start up the editor in the usual way, referencing the element you'd like to edit, e.g:  '%g%l%(edit%) myarray[2]%x' will start the editor, editing the %c%l2nd%x element of '%y%lmyarray%x' and '%g%l%(edit%) myarray[test]%x' will start the editor, editing the element with the index name '%y%ltest%x' of '%y%lmyarray%x'.

%PAGE
You can move around the elements of the dynamic array you're editing using the '%g%l%(.element%)%x' command, for example, typing '%g%l%(.element%) 3%x' will save the changes you've made to the element you're currently editing and start editing the %c%l3rd%x element.  You can use the keywords '%y%lFIRST%x', '%y%lLAST%x' and '%y%lEND%x' with '%g%l%(.element%)%x' if you like.

For further information on editing dynamic array elements (And using the editor), see '%g%l%<editor%>%x' and '%g%l%<.element%>%x'.

        @banish list [<PAGE NO>] [<NAME>]
        @banish check <NAME>%]%x

This command can only be used by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

'%g%l@banish%x' is used to banish the use of unsuitable, abusive, offensive, racist, etc. character names.  Once a character name has been banished, new users will not be able to be created with a name beginning with the banished name, and existing users will not be able to change their name to the banished name (Or a name which begins with it.)  Banished character names also can't be used in the name prefix or suffix of a character.

'%g%l@banish add <NAME> = <REASON>%x' is used to add a character name to the list of banished names, where %y%l<NAME>%x is the character name to add and %y%l<REASON>%x is the reason for banishing the name.  You can banish character names which currently don't exist in the database to prevent future use/misuse.  For example, '%g%l@banish add crap = some people might be offended by this name%x' will banish the use of the character names beginning with '%y%lCrap%x'.

%PAGE
'%g%l@banish remove <NAME> = <REASON>%x' will remove a character name from the list of banished names, where %y%l<NAME>%x is the character name to remove and %y%l<REASON>%x is reason for removing it from the banished list.  For example, '%g%l@banish remove wibble = this name isn't offensive enough to be banished%x' will remove the character name '%y%lWibble%x' from the banished list (If it has been banished.)

'%g%l@banish list%x' lists character names which are currently banished, sorted into alphabetical order.  If %y%l<NAME>%x is specified, names which contain the text %y%l<NAME>%x will be displayed only (For example, '%g%l@banish list fred%x' will only list banished character names which contain the text '%y%lfred%x'.)

%PAGE
If %y%l<PAGE NO>%x is specified, that page of banished names will be displayed (The first page is displayed by default), e.g:  '%g%l@banish list 2%x' will display the %c%l2nd%x page, '%g%l@banish list 3%x' will display the %c%l3rd%x, etc.

'%g%l@banish check%x' allows you to check for and list characters who have names beginning with %y%l<NAME>%x, i.e:  '%g%l@banish check fred%x' will list all characters who have names beginning with '%y%lFred%x'.  You can even check for names which aren't currently banished.

This command can only be used by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above, providing their %y%l%(BOOT%)%x flag hasn't been reset.

The '%g%l@boot%x' command can be used (As a last resort) to kick a character off %@%n (I.e:  If they're being abusive/harassive and refuse to stop, even after being given a %b%lMoron%x flag, etc.)

If %y%l<BAN TIME>%x is specified, the booted character will be banned for that amount of time (In minutes.)  This is ideal when booting abusive/problem users, as it can be used to stop them from simply connecting again as soon as they're booted.  The ban time can be between %c%l1%x and %c%l60%x minutes.  The '%g%l%(@ban%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@ban%>%x') can be used to impose longer bans.

'%g%l@bootdead%x' is used to get rid of 'dead' connections when your session has stopped responding.  When your character is connected multiple times (I.e:  Reconnecting after your connection has stopped responding will often result in you being connected twice), you'll need to use the '%g%l@bootdead%x' command to get rid of your connections which have stopped responding.

Simply type '%g%l@bootdead%x' and your connections which have stopped responding will be booted from %@%n (%c%lNOTE:  %xOnly connections with an idle time of more than %c%l1 minute%x will be booted.)

If you're an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above, you can optionally specify a %y%l<NAME>%x to boot the connections which have stopped responding of another character (If a user asks you to do this, you should tell them how to use the '%g%l@bootdead%x' command.)

'%g%lChat%x' is used to join and talk over a chatting channel.

To join a chatting channel, simply type '%g%lchat <CHANNEL NUMBER>%x' or '%g%lchat join <NAME>%x' (Or type '%g%lchat on%x' to join the default channel (%y%l0%x.))  %y%l<CHANNEL NUMBER>%x can be any positive number from %y%l0%x (Default) to %y%l2000000000+%x(!), so you can easily pick your own 'personal' chatting channel to chat to your friends over.

Once you've joined a channel, you can find out who else is on it by typing '%g%lchat who%x'.  If you're the first person on the channel, you become the '%c%lChannel Operator%x' and have a few extra privileges (Read on for details.)
%PAGE
You can speak over the chatting channel in the normal manner (I.e:  '%g%lchat "<MESSAGE>%x', '%g%lchat '<MESSAGE>%x', '%g%lchat :<MESSAGE>%x', etc.)  Only users on the same channel as you will hear what you say.

Typing '%g%lchat off%x' makes you leave the current chatting channel you're joined to and switches chat off.

If you're the '%c%lChannel Operator%x', you can type '%g%lchat private%x' to make your channel private (So no-one else can join it), and '%g%lchat public%x' to make it public again.  If someone's being a nuisance, you can kick them off (By typing '%g%lchat kick <NAME>%x') providing they aren't an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above (Of course, %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above can kick people off below their level (Including the '%c%lChannel Operator%x'.))
%PAGE
Typing '%g%lchat list%x' lists all chatting channels with 1 or more users on, the number of users on them, whether they're private or public, etc.

If you're the '%c%lChannel Operator%x', you can give your chatting channel a subject by typing '%g%lchat subject <SUBJECT>%x', e.g:  '%g%lchat subject Building on %@%m.%x'  Providing your chatting channel is %c%lpublic%x, users will see its subject under '%y%lPublic/Private/Subject%x' when they type '%g%lchat list%x'.

'%g%lchat%x' can be used by %c%lANYONE%x (Unlike the %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x and above '%g%l%(natter%)%x' channel.)

%8%c%lNOTE:  %xFor a prefix range match, %y%l<VALUE>%x must be prefixed by the range, e.g:  '%c%lTest%x' will match '%y%lA->Z%x' ('%y%lT%x' is within the range, and
       prefixes '%c%lTest%x'.)

The %y%l<CRITERIA>%x must be followed by '%g%l:%x' and the %y%l<COMMAND>%x to execute, or if you wish to execute more than one command, '%g%l%(@begin%)%x' (See '%g%l%(@begin%)%x'), followed by the command(s) on separate lines, and finally, '%g%l%(@end%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@end%>%x') on a line by itself (See example below.)

When '%g%l@case%x' is matching against the specified criteria, it first matches against %c%lexact values%x, followed by %c%lranges%x, then %c%lwildcards%x and finally the %c%ldefault%x, if it has been specified.  Bear this in mind when writing '%g%l@case%x' statements, because the order of criteria can make a difference to the results when using it.  Place more important criteria near the %c%ltop%x of the '%g%l@case%x' statement and less important near the %c%lbottom%x.

In addition to '%g%l@case%x', you can also use '%g%l@casefirst%x' or '%g%l@caserandom%x'.  These are identical to '%g%l@case%x', except '%g%l@casefirst%x' stops at the very %c%lfirst%x match it finds, and '%g%l@caserandom%x' picks a %c%lrandom%x condition from all those which match.

%PAGE
When using '%g%l@casefirst%x', order is %r%l%u*extremely*%x important.  If you place a range (E.g:  '%y%lA-Z%x') before an exact value (E.g:  '%y%ltest%x'), the range will %c%l%ualways%x be matched instead of '%y%ltest%x'.  '%g%l@casefirst%x' may be slightly more efficient than '%g%l@case%x', due to the fact that it does not need to match against every condition in the case statement.

With '%g%l@caserandom%x', you can specify multiple identical %y%l<CONDITION>%x statements.  One at %c%lrandom%x will be picked when the condition is matched, e.g:

   %g%l%[%(@command%) CaseRandom =\
   @caserandom $3 do\
      rand:%(@echo%) Random value %%w%%l1%%x.\
      rand:%(@echo%) Random value %%w%%l2%%x.\

The reserved variables %y%l$6%x and %y%l$7%x are useful in an '%g%l@case%x' statement  -  These substitute the following...

%y%l$6%x substitutes the matched %y%l<CONDITION>%x statement.
%y%l$7%x substitutes the second value of a range, if %y%l<CONDITION>%x is a range.

This command can only be used by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above from within a compound command.

%@%m remembers the last command typed by every user who is currently logged on.  This allows you to recall (Execute) the last command you typed (By typing '%g%l%(!!%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<!!%>%x') and Admin to list the last command typed by every user (Or a particular user), using the '%g%l%(last%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<last%>%x'.)  This facility enables Admin to help new users (By being able to see what they are doing wrong.)

To prevent invasion of privacy, all built-in communication commands (I.e:  '%g%l%(say%)%x', '%g%l%(page%)%x', '%g%l%(tell%)%x', etc.) are censored, so that Admin %c%lCAN'T%x 'snoop' on the private conversations of users.

%PAGE
However, user-created custom communications commands (I.e:  Constructed with compound commands) are not subject to censorship by default, and will appear in the '%g%l%(last%)%x' commands listing.

If '%g%l@censor%x' is placed at the beginning of a compound command (Or linked sequence of compound commands), use of the compound command will be censored in the '%g%l%(last%)%x' commands listing, allowing complete guaranteed privacy for its users.

If the editor (See '%g%leditor%x') is started from a compound command, and '%g%l@censor%x' is executed before the compound command finishes, the edit session will be censored (With the exception of executing a command, using '%g%l%(.execute%)%x' or '%g%l%(.x%)%x', unless it's normally censored on the command-line.)

'%g%l@censor%x' may be used from within a Mortal owned compound command, providing it either has its %y%l%(APPRENTICE%)%x or %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x flag set.

This command can only be used within a compound command.

When used in a compound command, '%g%l@chpid%x' gives the person who executed the compound command the privileges of the owner of the compound command.

Privileges picked up through '%g%l@chpid%x' remain in effect until the compound command finishes executing or when another compound command is called (Either via the '%g%l%(@csucc%)%x'/'%g%l%(@cfail%)%x' links (See '%g%l%<@csucc%>%x' and '%g%l%<@cfail%>%x') or from within the compound command itself.)  Privileges picked up through '%g%l@chpid%x' can also be cancelled out by using the '%g%l%(@unchpid%)%x' command.

You'll find you need to use an '%g%l@chpid%x' at the beginning of any compound command that modifies objects you own, references objects you own by ID number or gets the contents of various fields via query commands (E.g:  '%g%l{%(@?drop%) <OBJECT>}%x'.

%PAGE
%8%c%lNOTE:  %xWhen a character executes a compound command that is not owned by themselves, write permission from within the compound command will be denied to both the character and their objects unless the %y%l%(APPRENTICE%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<apprentice flag%>%x') is set on the compound command, or it is owned by an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above.

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@command%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@command <NAME>[;<NAME>][;<NAME>...] [= <COMMANDS>]%]%x

Creates a compound command with the name %y%l<NAME>%x (Building Quota used:  %c%l10%x.)  The compound command can be given multiple names by seperated them with semicolons ('%y%l;%x'), however the names mustn't have spaces in them, e.g:  '%g%l@command gohome;house;residence%x'.

The most easiest and user-friendly way to write/modify a compound command is with the editor (See '%g%l%<editor%>%x' for full details on how to it.)  You can create a new compound command and start entering the commands it should execute by typing '%g%l%(edit%) command desc <NAME>[;<NAME>][;<NAME>...]%x', or edit an existing compound command by typing '%g%l%(edit%) <NAME>%x'.

In its simplest (And probably most easiest to understand) form, a compound command simply holds a list of the commands (Each on a separate line) it should execute (In sequence, as though you typed them yourself on your keyboard) in its description, for example, the compound command '%y%lgohome%x' could be described (Using the editor) as follows (E.g:  '%g%l%(edit%) command desc gohome%x')...

%PAGE
%[%g%l:waves to all %%p friends and heads off to %%p home.
%(home%)
:wanders in from outside.%]%x

On typing '%y%lgohome%x', the above commands would be executed in sequence (As though you actually typed them yourself on your keyboard), making you emote '<YOUR NAME> %c%lwaves to all %p friends and heads off to %p home.%x', then go home and then emote '<YOUR NAME> %c%lwanders in from outside.%x'

%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %x'%y%l%%p%x' is a pronoun substitution which returns '%y%lhis%x', '%y%lher%x' or '%y%lits%x' appropriately depending on your gender  -  See '%g%l%<substitutions%>%x' for more details.

The above is fine, but what happens if you wanted to make a compound command that takes a parameter and does something appropriate to whatever parameter it was given?

%PAGE
The compound command system built into %@%m is very powerful and supports most features you'd expect to find in a high-level programming language, including %c%lflow control%x (See '%g%l%<@break%>%x', '%g%l%<@breakloop%>%x', '%g%l%<@return%>%x' and '%g%l%<@goto%>%x'), '%c%lIf...Then...Else%x' selection (See '%g%l%<@if%>%x'), '%c%lFor%x' (See '%g%l%<@for%>%x') and '%c%lWhile%x' (See '%g%l%<@while%>%x') loops, %c%lvariables%x (See '%g%l%<@temp%>%x'), %c%larrays%x (See '%g%l%<arrays%>%x'), etc.  Other features include %c%lstring%x, %c%lsentence%x and %c%llist%x processing (See '%g%l%<advanced queries%>%x' and '%g%l%<@foreach%>%x'), %c%llinked list processing%x (See '%g%l%<@with%>%x') and %c%linheritance%x (See '%g%l%<inheritance%>%x'.)

%y%lDON'T WORRY%x if you're not a programmer, and just the thought of programming makes you shiver  -  %@%m's compound command system is designed to be easy for non-programmers to learn and use  -  There's no bewildering command set or programming language to learn;  You just simply use commands similar to the ones you've already used when chatting and exploring in the virtual world of %@%n.

Now it's time to learn how to write slightly more complex compound commands...

%PAGE

%c%l%$'%y%l%${<COMMAND>}%c%l%$' (Substitute return result of %w%l%$<COMMAND>%c%l%$)...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
'%y%l{<COMMAND>}%x' is used to execute the %@%m command %y%l<COMMAND>%x and substitute its return result in place of the '%y%l{<COMMAND>}%x', e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?name%) me}%x'  -  '%y%l@?name me%x' is executed first and the return result (Your name) is substituted in place of '%y%l{@?name me}%x' (Giving '%g%l%(@echo%) %{@?name}%x'.)  The '%g%l%(@echo%)%x' command simply echoes its parameters to your screen (See '%g%l%<@echo%>%x'.)

Try typing '%g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?name%) me}%x' and watch what happens.  Now replace '%y%l@?name%x' with '%y%l@?desc%x' or '%y%l@?race%x'.  A command that starts with '%y%l@?%x' is called a %c%lQUERY COMMAND%x  -  See '%g%l%<2%>%x' and '%g%l%<5%>%x' for lists of the other main query commands you can use.

Commands in '%y%l{}%x's can be nested, e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?name%) {%(@?location%) me}}%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$'%y%l%$$<NAME>%c%l%$' (Substitute contents of variable %w%l%$<NAME>%c%l%$)...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
A '%y%l$%x' in %@%m is used to reference and substitute the contents of a variable (Either reserved (%c%l$0%x - %c%l$9%x) or user defined (Which can be a %c%l%(temporary variable%)%x (See '%g%l%<@temp%>%x'), %c%l%(property%)%x (See '%g%l%<@property%>%x'), %c%l%(variable%)%x (See '%g%l%<@variable%>%x') or %c%l%(dynamic array%)%x element (See '%g%l%<@array%>%x'), e.g:  '%y%l$myvariable%x'.))

Please see '%g%l%<variable subst%>%x' for further information on how to substitute temporary variables, variables, properties, dynamic array elements, etc.

Reserved variables (%c%l$0%x - %c%l$9%x) are built into %@%m and are mainly used within compound commands.

%c%l%$Protecting '%w%l%$$%c%l%$'s, '%w%l%${%c%l%$'s and '%w%l%$\%c%l%$'s...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
You may have noticed that when you try to say something with a '%y%l{%x' or '%y%l\%x' in it, your message ends up with either '%c%l<UNKNOWN VARIABLE>%x', '%c%lError%x' or absolutely nothing substituted in place of where the '%y%l{%x' or '%y%l\%x' should have been.  This is because %@%n either tried to execute it as a command ('%y%l{%x') or took it as a protecting backslash ('%y%l\%x'.)

To use a '%y%l{%x' or '%y%l\%x' in your spoken messages, etc. you must protect it with a backslash ('%y%l\%x'), e.g:  '%g%l%(say%) \{ = Curly bracket, \\ = Backslash.%x'  Try typing this with and without the protecting backslashes and see what happens.

When using the editor, '%y%l{%x's and '%y%l\%x's are %c%lNOT%x evaluated, which means you %c%lDON'T%x need to precede them with a protecting backslash.  This makes the editor especially ideal for writing compound commands.

'%y%l$%x's also need to be protected within compound commands, otherwise they will be looked up as the name of a variable.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Compound command parameters...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
When a compound command is executed, it can be given up to two parameters, separated with an equals sign ('%y%l=%x'.)  The reserved variables %y%l$1%x, %y%l$2%x and %y%l$3%x are used to return these parameters within the compound command, e.g:

%g%lmycommand param1 = param2%x

If the compound command '%y%lmycommand%x' was executed as above, the first parameter (%y%l$1%x) would be set to the text '%y%lparam1%x' and the second (%y%l$2%x) would be set to '%y%lparam2%x'.  %y%l$3%x would be set to '%y%lparam1 = param2%x' (Both parameters, including the '%y%l=%x'.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Example...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~%x
Using the editor, create a compound command and describe it as follows...

%[%g%l@echo Parameter 1 (\$1) is:  $1
@echo Parameter 2 (\$2) is:  $2
@echo Both parameters together (\$3) are:  $3%]%x

(Note the use of protecting backslashes)  Now try executing this command, giving it a variety of parameters and watch what happens.  Try giving it a single parameter (E.g:  '%y%lhello%x') as well as two parameters (E.g:  '%y%lparam1 = param2%x'.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Success and failure...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
Every %@%m command executed either succeeds or fails, returning an appropriate return result (In most cases, '%y%lOK%x' (%g%lCommand succeeded%x) and '%y%lError%x' (%r%lCommand failed%x.))

The last command executed in a compound command determines whether the compound command succeeds or fails.

If it succeeds, the compound command's success (See '%g%l%<@succ%>%x') and others success (See '%g%l%<@osucc%>%x') messages are displayed (If set) and the compound command that the csuccess (See '%g%l%<@csucc%>%x') is linked to is executed.

If it fails, the compound command's failure (See '%g%l%<@fail%>%x') and others failure (See '%g%l%<@ofail%>%x') messages are displayed (If set) and the compound command that the cfailure (See '%g%l%<@cfail%>%x') is linked to is executed.

%c%l%$Modulising compound commands...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
When creating a compound command which consists of more than just a single compound command, you can teleport all the sub-compound commands (I.e:  Those called via csuccess/cfailure, etc.) into the first compound command (I.e:  The one which users type the name of.)  This helps keep your compound commands neat and managable, and keeps all their related parts together in one place (You can also teleport variables, properties and dynamic arrays into the module.)  E.g:  '%g%l%(@tel%) mycommand.test = mycommand%x'.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Further education...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
The best way to learn how to write compound commands (Especially more complex ones) is to experiment.  If you haven't already got a %y%l%(BUILDER%)%x flag, which allows you to build things (Including compound commands), ask someone who's Admin to give you one (Type '%g%l%(who%) admin%x' to see the names of currently connected %@%m Admin.)

If you get stuck writing a compound command, or need any help, don't hesitate to ask someone who's Admin or anyone else who's a Builder (Builders have '%y%lB%x' in their flags on the '%g%l%(who%)%x' list)  -  Most fellow Builders (Especially the more proficient ones) will be happy to help you out if no Admin are connected, or are currently very busy.

%TITLE Help on %w%lsubstitutions%x
%@%n has an extensive set of substitutions, which can be used in almost any message/text (Regardless of whether it's said, %(emote%)d, %(page%)d, %(whisper%)ed, etc.)  They can also be used with '%g%l%(@echo%)%x', '%g%l%(@oecho%)%x', '%g%l%(@write%)%x', '%g%l%(@oemote%)%x' and in the '%g%l%(@desc%)%x', '%g%l%(@odesc%)%x', '%g%l%(@succ%)%x', '%g%l%(@osucc%)%x', '%g%l%(@fail%)%x', '%g%l%(@ofail%)%x', '%g%l%(@drop%)%x' and '%g%l%(@odrop%)%x' of %(rooms%), %(objects%), %(compound commands%), %(exits%), etc.

All substitutions consist of a '%y%l%%%x' followed by a letter/digit which denotes which substitution is to be used (With the exception of '%g%l%%{<CMD>}%x', which substitutes the return result of a query command.)  For example, if you put '%y%lHello, %%n!%x' in your description ('%g%l%(@desc%) me = Hello, %%n!%x'), then when other users '%g%l%(scan%)%x' you, they will see '%c%lHello, <NAME>!%x' (Where %c%l<NAME>%x is the name of the character scanning you.)

Substitutions may also be used in a similar way to query commands (See '%g%l%<queries%>%x') by placing them inside %y%l{}%x's, e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) The substitution "%%@%%n" is {%(@?length%) "{%%@%%n}"} characters in length.%x' (Displays '%c%lThe substitution "%@%n" is %{@?length "{%@%n}"} characters in length.%x' on your screen.)

%PAGE
%8%c%lNOTE:  %x'%y%l%%%%%x' is a special substitution, which simply returns '%y%l%%%x', allowing you to use a '%y%l%%%x' followed by text which would otherwise be seen as a substitution, e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) %%%%r%%%%l gives %%r%%lred%%x text.%x'

There are 6 different types of substitutions available on %@%n  -  These are as follows...

%r%l*  %c%lPronoun%x substitutions ('%g%l%<subst 3%>%x'.)
%y%l*  %c%lText %r%lc%g%lo%y%ll%b%lo%m%lu%c%lr%x and %c%lattribute%x substitutions ('%g%l%<subst 5%>%x'.)
%r%l*  %c%lText formatting%x substitutions ('%g%l%<subst 10%>%x'.)
%y%l*  %c%lHTML%x (World Wide Web) substitutions ('%g%l%<subst 11%>%x'.)
%r%l*  %c%lQuery command/calculation%x substitutions ('%g%l%<subst 15%>%x'.)
%y%l*  %c%lMiscellaneous%x substitutions ('%g%l%<subst 16%>%x'.)
%r%l*  %c%lVariable%x substitutions (See '%g%l%<variable subst%>%x'.)

Each type of substitution is explained in more detail on the following pages...

%PAGE

%c%l%$Pronoun substitutions...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
Pronoun substitutions return an appropriate pronoun in relation to the user involking the text, e.g:  '%g%l%(say%) %%S%x' will make you say "%y%lHe%x" to everyone in the same room as you, if you're male.  The returned pronoun can be either %c%labsolute%x (%g%l%%a%x), %c%lobjective%x (%g%l%%o%x), %c%lpossessive%x (%g%l%%p%x), %c%lsubjective%x (%g%l%%s%x) or %c%lreflexive%x (%g%l%%v%x), depending on the substitution used (See table on the next page.)

%c%l%$Text formatting substitutions...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
Text formatting substitutions allow you to set a hanging indent on a single line, so that if that line is longer than the screen width, it will be indented correctly when it's wrapped to the left hand side of the screen on the next line down.  To increment the hanging indent for a single line, you should use the '%y%l%%1%x' - '%y%l%%9%x' substitutions at the %c%lBEGINNING%x of the line, which increment the hanging indent by the given number (E.g:  '%y%l%%1%x' will increment the hanging indent by %c%l1%x, '%y%l%%2%x' by %c%l2%x, etc.)  '%y%l%%0%x' resets the hanging indent back to the far left hand side of the screen.

%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xTo increment the hanging indent by more than 9, you will need to use %c%lTWO%x or more substitutions added together, as only values of %y%l1%x to %y%l9%x can be used.

%c%l%$HTML (World Wide Web) substitutions...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
%y%l%@%n World Wide Web Interface%x allows users to connect through a standard World Wide Web browser (Such as %c%lNetscape Navigator%x or %c%lMicrosoft Internet Explorer%x)  -  See '%g%l%<html%>%x' for further details.  Several substitutions are provided to support the use of the HTML language within %@%m.


%c%l%$The '%w%l%$%%h%c%l%$' substitution
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe '%y%l%%h%x' substitution toggles the evaluation of HTML tags.  By default, HTML tags are ignored by %@%m and will be relayed to your browser just as though they were ordinary text.

%PAGE
However, by using the '%y%l%%h%x' substitution, you can turn evaluation of HTML tags on, allowing you to use HTML tags in %c%lyour description%x, %c%lroom descriptions%x, etc.  For example, '%g%l%(@echo%) %%h<FONT SIZE=6>Some big text</FONT>%%h%x'.  The first use of '%y%l%%h%x' in a description, etc. will turn evaluation of HTML on, the second will turn it off again, the 3rd on, etc.  After the description has been displayed, evaluation of HTML is automatically turned off again (If it's turned on.)

To prevent abuse (I.e:  Spamming large pictures, JAVA code, etc.) the '%y%l%%h%x' substitution will have no effect when used in communication commands (I.e:  '%g%l%(say%)%x', '%g%l%(tell%)%x', etc.  -  See '%g%l%<communicating%>%x') in areas you do not own or have '%c%lwrite%x' permission to.

%PAGE

%c%l%$The '%w%l%$%%|%c%l%$' and '%w%l%$%%^%c%l%$' substitutions
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe '%y%l%%|%x' substitution filters out all text between it and the next '%y%l%%|%x' substitution, if the user is connected through %c%lTelnet%x.  Similarly, the '%y%l%%^%x' substitution filters out all text between it and the next '%y%l%%^%x', if the user is connected through the %c%lWorld Wide Web Interface%x.  These substitutions can be used to provide different descriptions or filter out text/HTML tags depending on whether the user is using %c%lTelnet%x or a %c%lWorld Wide Web browser%x, i.e:

   %4%g%l%%|%%h<CENTER><IMG SRC="http://www.wibble.com/mypic.jpg"><P>This is what I look like IRL!</CENTER>%%h%%|%%^This is a description of what I look like, for those of you using a text-only Telnet connection.%%^%x

If you used the above example for your description, the user would see a picture of you (Providing you gave a valid URL for it) if they were using a %c%lWorld Wide Web browser%x.  Otherwise, they would see a text description of what you look like (Providing you write it.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$The '%w%l%$%%[%c%l%$' and '%w%l%$%%]%c%l%$' substitutions
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe above two substitutions are effectively aliases for the '%y%l<PRE>%x' and '%y%l</PRE>%x' HTML tags respectively.  Because web browsers do not use a %c%lfixed width font%x by default, 'ASCII art', descriptions, compound commands, etc. which rely on the fixed width font of %c%lTelnet software%x will look extremely messy.  There is a solution however:  By enclosing the text within a '%y%l%%[%x' and '%y%l%%]%x' substitution, it will be rendered in a fixed width font.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Query command/calculation substitutions...%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l%%{%(@calc%) <CALCULATION>}
        %%{%(@eval%) <CALCULATION>}
        %%{<QUERY COMMAND>}%]%x

The above substitutions can be used to substitute the result of a calculation performed with the '%g%l%(@calc%)%x'/'%g%l%(@eval%)%x' command (E.g:  '%g%l%%{%(@eval%) 2 + 2}%x'), or substitute the return result of a standard query command (E.g:  '%g%l%%{%(@?race%)}%x'.)


%c%l%$Example:%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~%x
%g%l%(@thing%) clock = Looking at the clock, you see the time is %\{%(@?realtime%)}.

Variable substitution can be used to substitute the description of a %c%l%(temporary variable%)%x (See '%g%l%<@temp%>%x')/%c%l%(property%)%x (See '%g%l%<@property%>%x')/%c%l%(variable%)%x (See '%g%l%<@variable%>%x') or element of a %c%l%(dynamic array%)%x (See '%g%l%<@array%>%x') in a compound command.

The first two forms of variable substitution ('%y%l$[#<LOCATION>:]<VARIABLE NAME>%x' and '%y%l$([#<LOCATION>:]<VARIABLE NAME>)%x') can only be used within compound commands.  The third ('%y%l{$[#<LOCATION>:]<VARIABLE NAME>}%x') can also be used on the command line as well as in compound commands.

%PAGE
In the simplest form, a temporary variable can be substituted using '%y%l$<VARIABLE NAME>%x' (E.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) $mytemp%x').  A property/variable can be substituted using '%y%l$(#<LOCATION>:<VARIABLE NAME>)%x', where '%y%l#<LOCATION>%x' is the #ID number of the property/variable's current location (E.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) $(#12345:myproperty)%x') and a dynamic array element can be substituted using '%y%l$(#<LOCATION>:<ARRAY NAME>[<ELEMENT>])%x' (E.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) $(#12345:myarray[1])%x'.)

A '%y%l$()%x' substitution can be used to substitute a property/variable/array which has spaces in its name (E.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) $(#12345:my property)%x'.  It's also useful in the following case:  '%g%l%(@echo%) $sentence.%x' (Where '%y%l$sentence%x' is a temporary variable containing a sentence of text.)  -  This substitution wont work, because '%y%l.%x' is a valid character for use in a variable substitution, so %@%m tries to find and substitute a temporary variable/property/variable/array with the name '%y%lsentence.%x'  You can get around this by using '%g%l%(@echo%) $(sentence).%x'  -  Only the text in the '%y%l()%x's is taken as the name.

%PAGE
Nested substitutions are possible using '%y%l{$[#<LOCATION>:]<VARIABLE NAME>}%x', e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) $(#12345:myarray[{$element}])%x' (Where '%y%l$element%x' is a temporary variable holding the element number to substitute.)

%TITLE Hierarchical Object Matching
Understanding how hierarchical object matching works on %@%m is an important part of coding compound commands.  It is also important for the usage of many built-in (Hard-coded) commands.)

Nearly all built-in (Hard-coded) compound commands use hierarchical object matching in one form or another.  The following pages detail the various methods of matching supported by %@%m...

%9%3%y%l%$me%x%|%h<HR>%h%|         Matches to yourself.

%[           %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(@set%) me = %(haven%)%]%x

%9%3%y%l%$here%x%|%h<HR>%h%|       Matches to your current location.

%[           %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(examine%) here%]%x

%PAGE

%9%3%y%l%$[!]<NAME>%x%|%h<HR>%h%|  Matches by object name.  Your possessions are searched first, followed by your current location.  Compound commands are also searched up the area tree of your current location and within the global compound commands location.

           For characters and things, matching is %c%lpartial%x (I.e:  Any part of the object's name.)  For most other object types, matching is %c%lexact%x.

%[           %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(look%) at cupboard
                 %(take%) key
                 %(open%) door%]%x

           Sometimes, partial matching of an object name can be a nuisance (I.e:  When there are two objects with similar names.)  You can force an exact match by preceeding the name with '%y%l!%x', e.g:

%PAGE

%[              %y%l%$Contents:
              %~%y~~~~~~~~~
              %xObject2(#12345 Tq)
              Object(#54321 Tq)%]

           In the above example, typing '%g%l%(ex%) object%x', '%g%l%(ex%) obj%x', etc.  will match to '%y%lObject2%x', because it's first in the %y%l%$Contents:%x list.  This makes it difficult to refer to '%y%lObject%x' without knowing and using it's #ID.  Typing '%g%l%(ex%) !object%x' solves this problem by forcing an exact match to the name '%y%lobject%x'.

%9%3%y%l%$*<NAME>%x%|%h<HR>%h%|    Matches exactly to the character name specified, regardless of their current location or whether they are currently connected or not.

%[           %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(look%) at *fred bloggs%]%x

%PAGE

%9%3%y%l%$#<ID>%x%|%h<HR>%h%|      Matches directly to the object with the specified %y%l#<ID>%x number.  This is the fastest method of matching.

%[           %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(@tel%) me = #12345%]%x

%c%l%8NOTE:%x  Within a compound command, all of the above are relative to the user executing the compound command.  For example, '%y%lme%x' refers to the user executing the compound command, '%y%lhere%x' refers to their current location, etc.

%PAGE

%c%l%$The following are functional only from within a compound command:
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%x
%9%1%y%l%$myself%x%|%h<HR>%h%|   Matches to the compound command currently executing (Same functionality as '%g%l{%(@?myself%)}%x' (See '%g%l%<@?myself%>%x'), but easier to use and more efficient.)

%[         %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?drop%) myself}
               %(@drop%) myself = 1%]%x

%9%1%y%l%$myleaf%x%|%h<HR>%h%|   Matches to effective location of the compound command currently executing (Same functionality as '%g%l{%(@?myleaf%)}%x' with no parameters.)

         See '%g%l%<@?myleaf%>%x' for details of how '%g%l{%(@?myleaf%)}%x' works.

%[         %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(@echo%) You shoot the {%(@?name%) myleaf} - BANG!%]%x

For details on the order of matching, please see '%g%l%<matching order%>%x'

%PAGE

%c%l%$Character Matching
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xFor ease of use and effeciency, most internal commands (Hard-coded) which can %m%lONLY%x be used on characters ('%g%l%(scan%)%x', '%g%l%(page%)%x', '%g%l%(tell%)%x', etc.) use a cut-down matching system.  This is as follows:

%9%1%y%l%$me%x%|%h<HR>%h%|       Matches to yourself.

%[         %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(scan%) me%]%x

%9%1%y%l%$<NAME>%x%|%h<HR>%h%|   Matches by character name.  Names of connected characters are matched first, followed by names of those who are not connected.  Matching is to the closest character name, taking name prefix/suffix into account.

%[         %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(page%) fred bloggs = hello%]%x

%PAGE

%9%1%y%l%$*<NAME>%x%|%h<HR>%h%|  Matches exactly to character name specified.

%[         %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(look%) at *fred bloggs%]%x

%9%1%y%l%$#<ID>%x%|%h<HR>%h%|    Matches directly to the character with the specified %y%l#<ID>%x number.  This is the fastest method of matching.  %c%lNOTE:%x  You need read permission to a character to refer to them by %y%l#<ID>%x.

%[         %c%lE.g:  %g%l%(examine%) #1%]%x

%c%l%8NOTE:%x  Character matching does not support (Or need to support) %c%ltype matching%x or %c%lmultiple matching%x.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Type Matching
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@<TYPE>[;<TYPE>][...]:<MATCH>%]%x

Matching can be restricted to a particular object type (Or particular object types) only by using the above matching format.  To restrict a match to a particular type of object, simply prefix the match with '%y%l@%x' followed by the object type, e.g:  '%y%l@things:mything%x', '%y%l@properties:me:myobject%x', '%y%l@things;commands:myobject%x', etc.

%y%l<TYPE>%x is the object type, which can be one or more of the following:

   %4%y%lAlarms%x, %y%lArrays%x, %y%lCharacters%x, %y%lCommands%x, %y%lExits%x, %y%lFuses%x, %y%lPlayers%x (Same as %y%lCharacters%x), %y%lProperties%x, %y%lRooms%x, %y%lThings%x, %y%lVariables%x.

%PAGE
Type matching is especially useful for preventing matching conflicts between objects of different types with the same name.  For example, if you had a thing and compound command both called '%y%lTest%x', typing '%g%l%(ex%) test%x' will always match to the thing.  Typing '%g%l%(@desc%) test = @echo Hello%x' would change the description of the thing rather than the compound command.

Rather than directly refering to the compound command by it's #ID, you can get around this problem by using '%y%l@command:test%x' to match against compound commands only.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Multiple Matching
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lFORMAT:  %g%l<LOCATION>:<OBJECT NAME>[:<OBJECT NAME>][...]%]%x

The above format is used for multiple matching.  This allows you to refer to an object located within another object, or several objects located within each other in a hierarchical manner.

For example, '%y%l#12345:mycontainer:mything%x' searches the location %y%l#12345%x for the object '%y%lmycontainer%x'.  '%y%lMyContainer%x' is then searched for the object '%y%lmything%x'.

%PAGE
This method of matching is especially useful for refering to variables, properties and dynamic arrays attached to objects, e.g:

%[   %g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?desc%) #12345:myarray[1]}
   %g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?desc%) me:myproperty}
   %g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?desc%) #54321:mything:myvariable}%]%x

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@parent%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@parent <OBJECT> [= <PARENT>]%]%x

If %y%l<PARENT>%x is specified, the parent object of %y%l<OBJECT>%x is set to the object %y%l<PARENT>%x, providing %y%l<OBJECT>%x is the same type as %y%l<PARENT>%x.  If %y%l<PARENT>%x isn't specified, %y%l<OBJECT>%x's parent object is reset.

Objects may only have one parent, but you can create chains of parent objects (Providing they don't create an endless loop (Which %@%m doesn't allow)), e.g:  '%g%l@parent object1 = object2%x', '%g%l@parent object2 = object3%x'  -  If %c%lobject1%x's description isn't set, it will be inherited from %c%lobject2%x, but if %c%lobject2%x also doesn't have a description, %c%lobject1%x's description will be inherited from %c%lobject3%x.

Fields on the object (Description, (o)success, (o)failure, (o)drop, areaname, contents string, etc.) are inherited from the parent object when they aren't set (E.g:  If the object has no description, it will be inherited from the parent object.)

%PAGE
If the object isn't locked, its lock will be inherited from the parent object (If you don't want the object locked, but want the parent object locked, simply do '%g%l%(@lock%) object = me|!me%x' (This will have the same effect as not locking the object and will prevent the lock from being inherited.))  The lock key of a thing is inherited in the same way.

The object's volume and/or mass may be inherited from the parent object by setting them to %y%lINHERIT%x (E.g:  '%g%l%(@volume%) <OBJECT> = inherit%x' (See '%g%l%<@volume%>%x') and '%g%l%(@mass%) <OBJECT> = inherit%x' (See '%g%l%<@mass%>%x'.))

Object lists of the object's parent object are inherited, so objects in the contents list of the parent object will also appear in the contents list of the object's children, etc.  All object lists are inherited, including compound commands, exits, fuses, etc.

%PAGE
%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xObject lists are inherited regardless of whether the object's various lists are empty or not.  For example, the object's commands list could contain compound commands actually attached to the object as well as compound commands inherited from the parent object.  Type '%g%l%(examine%) <OBJECT>%x' to find out what's been inherited and from where.

If a character is given a parent, the aliases of their parent will be inherited.  This works in the same way as object lists, so the character will not only have their own aliases, but also the aliases of their parent.  Aliases of the parent character can't be modified or removed by the child.

%TITLE Help on %w%larticles%x...
Article support in %@%n allows you to set an appropriate article ('%y%lA%x', '%y%lAn%x' or '%y%lSome%x') on an object, which will then be used in all messages relating to that object (E.g:  'Fred Bloggs %g%ldrops some %xSweets.' instead of 'Fred Bloggs %g%ldrops %xSweets.')

The flags %y%l%(CONSONANT%)%x (%c%lA%x), %y%l%(VOWEL%)%x (%c%lAn%x) and %y%l%(PLURAL%)%x (%c%lSome%x) determine the article of an object, and may be set on %c%l%(things%)%x, %c%l%(rooms%)%x, %c%l%(exits%)%x and %c%l%(characters%)%x (E.g:  '%g%l%(@set%) sweets = %(PLURAL%)%x'.)

Article support can be taken advantage of within compound commands by specifying '%y%ldefinite%x' or '%y%lindefinite%x' as the second parameter to the following query commands:  '%g%l{%(@?name%)}%x', '%g%l{%(@?article%)}%x', '%g%l{%(@?namec%)}%x' and '%g%l{%(@?fullname%)}%x', e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) {%(@?name%) sweets = INDEFINITE}%x' would give '%c%lSome Sweets%x'.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@partner [engage|marry|divorce] <NAME1> [= <NAME2>]%]%x

This command can only be used by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

It allows two characters to be first engaged to each other, then subsequently married.  It also allows engaged or married couples to be divorced.

The first step is to propose to your partner, after which (If successful), you can ask a member of Admin to link you both as engaged.  They can do this by typing '%g%l@partner engage <NAME1> = <NAME2>%x', where one name is yours, and the other is your partner.

The next step is marriage.  You can ask a member of Admin to marry you and your partner (A wedding ceremony will usually be held.)  They can do this by typing '%g%l@partner marry <NAME1> = <NAME2>%x'.

%PAGE
If you no-longer wish to be engaged to your partner, or your marriage doesn't go quite as planned, you can ask a member of Admin to divorce you and your partner.  They can do this by typing '%g%l@partner divorce <NAME>%x', where %y%l<NAME>%x is either your name, or your partners (It doesn't matter which.)

Once married, '%y%lMr%x'/'%y%lMrs%x' (Appropriately) will be added to your name prefixes (Unless either you or your partner's gender is neuter.)  Engaged/married characters appear in the '%y%l%$Contents:%x' list of their location with '%c%l(Engaged)%x' or '%c%l(Married)%x' after their name.  The character who they are engaged/married to is also shown to users who '%g%l%(scan%)%x' them (See '%g%l%<scan%>%x'.)

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@prompt <PROMPT> = <PROCESS CMD> = <SUCC CMD> [= <ABORT CMD>]%]%x

Starts an 'interactive' prompt session.  Basically, the user will be presented with the prompt %y%l<PROMPT>%x.  When they type something and press %c%lRETURN%x, the compound command %y%l<PROCESS CMD>%x will be executed, with what the user typed as its parameters.

If %y%l<PROCESS CMD>%x fails (E.g:  '%g%l%(@return%) false%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@return%>%x'), the user will again be presented with %y%l<PROMPT>%x, and the process repeated.  However, if %y%l<PROCESS CMD>%x succeeds, the compound command %y%l<SUCC CMD>%x will be executed, and the interactive '%g%l@prompt%x' session will end.

If the user types '%g%lABORT%x' during an interactive '%g%l@prompt%x' session, it will be aborted, and the compound command %y%l<ABORT CMD>%x will be executed (If specified.)

%PAGE
During an interactive '%g%l@prompt%x' session, the user may still use the On-Line Help System in the usual way, and can execute %@%m commands by typing '%g%l.<COMMAND>%x' (In a similar way to that used in '%g%l%(converse%)%x' mode (See '%g%l%<converse%>%x')), e.g:  '%g%l.%(tell%) <NAME> [=] <MESSAGE>%x'.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@property <NAME> [= <INITIAL SETTING>]%]%x

Creates a property called %y%l<NAME>%x attached to yourself (Building Quota used:  %c%l1%x.)  If %y%l<INITIAL SETTING>%x is specified, the description of the property is set to that.

Properties only have a description (Rather than all 8 standard fields), saving DB space and memory.  Because of this, properties use less Building Quota than variables.

You can attach a property to almost any other object (As long as you own/control it) by using '%g%l%(drop%)%x' or '%g%l%(@tel%)%x'.  You can even drop properties within properties.

%PAGE
When a property is on yourself, you can substitute it into any text you're typing by typing '%y%l$%x' followed by the name of the property (E.g:  '%g%l$myprop%x' would substitute the description of the property '%y%lMyprop%x'.)

To reference properties attached to anything else other than yourself, you must use '%y%l#<ID>:<PROPERTY NAME>%x', e.g:  If I had a property called '%y%lstore%x' attached to a thing called '%y%lCabinet%x' with the ID %y%l#12345%x, I could reference that property using '%g%l#12345:store%x', e.g:  To set the property's description, I'd type '%g%l@desc #12345:store = <DESCRIPTION>%x'.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@thing <NAME> [= <DESCRIPTION>]
        @create <NAME> [= <DESCRIPTION>]%]%x

Creates a thing with the name %y%l<NAME>%x (Building Quota used:  %c%l10%x.)  If %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x is specified, it's description is set to %y%l<DESCRIPTION>%x.  You can change its description at any time of course by using '%g%l%(@desc%)%x'.

A thing is a flexible type of object that can be virtually anything you want  -  Be it a %c%lsofa%x, %c%lbed%x, %c%lcomputer%x, %c%lcar%x, %c%ldustbin%x, you name it, it can be it.  A thing can also be made into a container, into which you can put other objects providing it has enough volume (A thing's volume is set using the '%g%l%(@volume%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@volume%>%x') command.)  If the container is big enough, other characters can even climb into it (Using the '%g%l%(enter%)%x' (See '%g%l%<enter%>%x') command.)

%PAGE
By default, any other user will be able to pick up the thing and carry it off to another location.  If you do not want this to happen, you will need to set the %y%l%(IMMOVABLE%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<immovable flag%>%x') on the thing by typing '%g%l%(@set%) <THING> = immovable%x' (See '%g%l%<@set%>%x'), e.g:  '%g%l%(@set%) sofa = immovable%x'.  This will prevent %c%lANYONE%x from moving it, including yourself.

You can selectively prevent users from moving an object by locking it (Using the '%g%l%(@lock%)%x' command  -  See '%g%l%<@lock%>%x') instead of setting its %y%l%(IMMOVABLE%)%x flag.  For example, '%g%l%(@lock%) <THING> = me%x' will prevent anyone other than yourself moving the object.  See '%g%l%<@lock%>%x' for further details on locks and locking objects.

If you want to turn the thing into a container, this can be done by setting its %y%l%(OPEN%)%x/%y%l%(OPENABLE%)%x flag(s).  See section on '%g%l%(@set%)%x' for more details.

%PAGE
When you turn a thing into a container, remember to set its mass and volume (Using '%g%l%(@mass%)%x' and '%g%l%(@volume%)%x'), otherwise it wont be big enough to hold anything.

You can remotely reference things by using '%g%l#<ID>:<THING>%x', e.g:  You could reference the thing '%y%lcomputer%x' inside room %y%l#12345%x by using '%g%l#12345:computer%x'.

This command can only be used by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

The '%g%l@credit%x' command adjusts the bank account ('%y%laccount%x') or the credit in pocket ('%y%lpocket%x') of the character %y%l<NAME>%x to %y%l<AMOUNT>%x credits.  It's main use is to deal with users who have obtained credit by unfair means or users who have managed their money badly and got themselves into severe debt.

Only %c%lWizards/%cDruids%x and above may reduce the bank account or credit in pocket of a user.  %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above may raise the total credit of a user who has less than %c%l100 credits%x to a maximum of %c%l1000 credits%x.

%PAGE
%g%lElder Wizards/%gDruids%x and above may set the bank account or credit in pocket of a user to any positive value.

A %y%l<REASON>%x in all cases must be given to use this command.  The bank account or credit in pocket of a user %r%l%fMUST NOT%x be altered unless you have %m%l%ugood reason%x (I.e:  User has obtained credit by unfair means.)

This is important, because improper use of this command (I.e:  Injecting excessive money into the system or taking it out) could ruin the entire monetary system and make it worthless.

The description of a compound command is the commands (On separate lines) that the compound command will execute.

%PAGE
'%g%l@desc%x' can also be used to set the description (Or contents if you like) of dynamic array elements, e.g:  '%g%l@desc myarray[2] = some text%x' will set the description of the %c%l2nd%x element of '%y%lmyarray%x' to '%y%lsome text%x' and '%g%l@desc myarray[test] = indexed element 'test'%x' will set the description of the element with the index name '%y%ltest%x' of '%y%lmyarray%x' to '%y%lindexed element 'test'%x'.

You can set the description of more than one dynamic array element at once by using a range, e.g:  '%g%l@desc myarray[4..7] = some more text%x' will set the description of elements %c%l4%x, %c%l5%x, %c%l6%x and %c%l7%x of '%y%lmyarray%x' to '%y%lsome more text%x'.

If the element(s) being described do not exist, they'll be created (Building Quota used by each new element:  %c%l1%x.)

        @request new%]%x

This command can only be used by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

The '%g%l@request%x' command is used to process requests for new characters from Internet sites which have been banned from creating new characters.

When a user attempts to create a character from an Internet site which has been banned from creating new characters, they will be asked if they wish to make a request for a character.  If they choose to do so, they will be asked for their E-mail address, which will be added to the end of the queue of requests for new characters.

%PAGE
To deal with these requests, simply type '%g%l@request new%x'.  This will take a request off the queue (Which hasn't been dealt with yet) and allocate it to you.  On typing '%g%l@request new%x', you will also be warned of any possible existing characters in the database with similar E-mail addresses to the E-mail address of the person making the request.  You will also be given a reference number for the request, which you will need to deal with the request (If you forget this, simply type '%g%l@request list%x' to list the requests you're currently dealing with.)

If other characters with similar E-mail addresses exist, please check these out and then E-mail the person who requested the new character, to determine whether they are trying to obtain duplicate characters or get around a ban placed on their usual character (Which is not allowed), i.e:

%PAGE
   %4%m%lHello, I am %{@?name}, an administrator from %@%n, responding to your request for a new character.  It appears you already have a character (Duplicate characters are not permitted), can you please explain why you are requesting another/new character?%x

If the request appears authentic and genuine, or a reasonable explaination is received from the user (After sending the above E-mail), you should then send an E-mail to the user, asking them which character name(s) they would like for their new character, i.e:

   %4%m%lHello, I am %{@?name}, an administrator from %@%n, responding to your request for a new character.  Your request for a new character has been accepted.  Can you please E-mail me a list of the names you would like for your new character (In order of preference)?%x

On receiving a list of suitable names, you can then create a character for them.  Please reject potentially offensive or abusive names.  If all of the names given by the user are already in use, offensive or invalid, please E-mail the user, requesting alternative names.

%PAGE
Use '%g%l%(@character%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@character%>%x') to create the character, assigning a random (%c%lLowercase%x) password to them (Approximately 8 characters in length), i.e:  '%g%l%(@character%) fred bloggs = djfcntvx%x'.  Once the new character is created, set their private E-mail address to the correct E-mail address of the user, using '%g%l%(@email%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@email%>%x'), i.e:  '%g%l%(@email%) fred bloggs = private fbloggs@wibble.wobble.com%x'.

You can now E-mail the details of their new character, i.e:

   %4%m%lHello, I am %{@?name}, an administrator from %@%n, responding to your request for a new character.  I have created a new character for you (You may like to set a more suitable password for them by typing %(@PASSWORD%) on %@%m):

   Name:  Fred Bloggs
   Password:  djfcntvx%x

%PAGE
Having successfully dealt with the request for the new character, you can now take them off the request queue, using the '%g%l@request accept <NUMBER> = <NAME>%x' command, where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the reference number of the request (Type '%g%l@request list%x' if you can't remember this) and %y%l<NAME>%x is the full name or #ID number of the new character you created for them, i.e:  '%g%l@request accept 12345 = fred bloggs%x'.

If you need to refuse a request (I.e:  The user making the request already has a character, or the E-mail address they gave is invalid), simply type '%g%l@request refuse <NUMBER> = <REASON>%x', i.e:  '%g%l@request refuse 12345 = This person already has a character on %@%m called Joe Bloggs%x'.  Please make sure you E-mail the user and explain why their request for a new character has been refused.

%PAGE
You can deal with more than one request at a time.  Simply type '%g%l@request new%x' until you have sufficient requests to deal with.  You can then list the requests you're currently dealing with by typing '%g%l@request list%x' (You will need to do this to obtain the reference numbers of the requests.)  If you are dealing with a lot of requests, the list may span several pages.  Simply type '%g%l@request list 2%x' to view the second page, '%g%l@request list 3%x' to view the third, etc.  You can view the E-mail address of an individual request, and check for existing characters with similar E-mail addresses by typing '%g%l@request <NUMBER>%x', where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the reference number of the request.

Please do not take on an excessive number of requests, or more requests than you can deal with effeciently  -  Please share requests with other administrators.

%PAGE
The second parameter of the '%g%l@request list%x' command can be used to list all requests (Including requests which haven't been dealt with yet), e.g:  '%g%l@request list = all%x'.  It can also be used to list requests currently being dealt with by a particular administrator, e.g:  '%g%l@request list = jc digita%x'.

The '%g%l@request cancel%x' command can be used to cancel a request which you have taken on and no-longer wish to deal with (Or are unable to do so.)  The request will be placed back on the queue for another administrator to deal with.  E.g:  '%g%l@request cancel 12345%x'.

Accepted/refused new character requests are logged to the '%c%lRequest%x' log file for future reference (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'.)

%c%lNOTE:  %xNew character requests expire after %y%l28 days%x.

Unlike '%g%l%(@break%)%x', neither the csuccess or cfailure of the compound command is executed, and the success/failure messages of the compound command are not displayed  -  The compound command will just finish at that point, failing if '%y%lfalse%x' is specified, succeeding if '%y%ltrue%x' or no parameter is specified or leaving the return result unchanged if '%y%lcurrent%x' is specified.

%8%c%lNOTE:  %x'%g%l@return%x' does not change the return value from the previous executed command.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@returnvalue <RETURN VALUE>%]%x

The '%g%l@returnvalue%x' command allows you to write compound commands which return a user-defined value or string instead of the usual '%c%lOK%x' or '%c%lError%x' return strings (Allowing you to use them as '%y%lfunctions%x'.)

'%g%l@returnvalue%x' sets the return value of the current compound command, e.g:

If you had a compound command called '%g%lmultiply%x', with its description set to:

%g%l@returnvalue {@eval $1 * 100}

%PAGE
...You could then type '%g%l%(@echo%) {multiply 10}%x' (This would display %c%l1000%x on your screen.)  The '%g%lmultiply%x' compound command multiplies the parameter given to it by 100 and then returns the resulting number.  In this case, the resulting number is echoed to your screen using the '%g%l%(@echo%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@echo%>%x') command.

The reserved variable %y%l$0%x can also be used to reference the return result of the compound command.  For example, you could put the following in another compound command to achieve the same result:

%[%g%lmultiply 10
@echo $0%]

%8%c%lNOTE:  %x'%g%l@returnvalue%x' does not change the return result (Success/failure) from the previous executed command.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@destall <NAME> = yes = <REASON>%]%x

This command can only be used by %c%lWizards/%cDruids%x and above.

'%g%l@destall%x' destroys %c%lALL%x objects owned by the character %y%l<NAME>%x, who must be a Mortal, Builder or %b%lMoron%x and set %y%l%(ASHCAN%)%x.

The main use of '%g%l@destall%x' is to destroy all of the objects owned by a character who was set %y%l%(ASHCAN%)%x by character maintenance, and it should %r%l%fNEVER%x be used without first checking what objects the character owns (They could own public locations.)

%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xObjects destroyed by '%g%l@destall%x' are destroyed %r%l%fPERMANENTLY%x and can't be recovered with the '%g%l%(@undestroy%)%x' command.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@destroy <OBJECT> [= yes|permanent]
        @destroy <ARRAY>[<ELEMENT>]
        @purge <OBJECT> [= yes]%]%x

This command destroys (Deletes) the specified %y%l<OBJECT>%x providing you own it, or are of a higher level than its owner, e.g:  '%g%l@destroy mything%x' will destroy the object '%y%lmything%x'.  '%g%l@destroy <OBJECT> = yes%x' must be typed to destroy an object which you do not own.

When you destroy an object, the amount of Building Quota (See '%g%l%<quota%>%x') used by it will be reimbursed to you.

You should destroy objects which are useless, no-longer needed or unwanted, as this will reimbursed the Building Quota used for you to use on something else, free up space in the database and also helps to reduce its size, rate of expansion and the overall total amount of junk/useless objects in it.

%PAGE
If you accidentally destroy an object (Or the wrong object), you can recover the destroyed object by using the '%g%l%(@undestroy%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@undestroy%>%x'.)

However, if a compound command of yours creates and destroys objects on a temporary basis (I.e:  Properties, variables or dynamic arrays), regular usage would result in the destroyed object queue (Which is a fixed size) becoming 'flooded' with objects which will never need to be recovered.

For this reason, the '%g%l@purge <OBJECT>%x' or '%g%l@destroy <OBJECT> = permanent%x' commands are provided to destroy an object permanently without placing it on the queue.  However, the object must be yours, or owned by the owner of the compound command the '%g%l@purge%x' command is used within (Otherwise, the object will still be placed on the queue.)

%PAGE
'%g%l@destroy%x' can also be used to destroy elements of a dynamic array (See '%g%l%<@array%>%x'), e.g:  '%g%l@destroy myarray[2]%x' will destroy the %c%l2nd%x element of the dynamic array '%y%lmyarray%x' and '%g%l@destroy myarray[test]%x' will destroy the element with the index name '%y%ltest%x' of '%y%lmyarray%x'.

A range of elements can be destroyed all in one go, e.g:  '%g%l@destroy myarray[4..7]%x' will destroy elements %c%l4%x, %c%l5%x, %c%l6%x and %c%l7%x.  When you destroy element(s) of a dynamic array, they are removed from the array altogether.

You can get into your newly created room by typing '%g%l%(@tel%) me = #<ID>%x', where %y%l#<ID>%x is the ID number of the room (%@%m displays this when you create it), e.g:  '%g%l%(@tel%) me = #1342%x'.

When you first get your %y%l%(BUILDER%)%x flag, you should create a room to use as your Top Area, and name it something like '%y%l<NAME>'s Top Area%x' (Where %y%l<NAME>%x is your name, of course.)  You should then ask an administrator to teleport it into the main Top Area for Builders.

%PAGE
When you create further rooms, you should use '%g%l%(@tel%)%x' to teleport them into your Top Area by typing '%g%l%(@tel%) <ROOM ID> = <YOUR TOP AREA ID>%x'.  Your Top Area will help you keep your building work properly organised.

'%g%l@duplicate%x' creates a duplicate of the object %y%l<OBJECT>%x.  If %y%l<NEW NAME>%x is specified, the duplicate will be given that name, otherwise it will be given the name of the object it was duplicated from.

If the optional parameter '%y%linherit%x' is given, the object will be duplicated so that it makes as much use of inheritance (See '%g%l%<inheritance%>%x') as possible, saving on memory usage.  The parent of the duplicated object is automatically set to the object it was duplicated from.

The duplicated object will use the same amount of Building Quota as the object it was duplicated from, so you need sufficient Building Quota to duplicate the object.

The '%g%l@email%x' command is used to set your public and private E-mail addresses.


%c%l%$Your private E-mail address
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xYou must at least set your private E-mail address (Especially if you wish to obtain building privileges, which will allow you to build your own rooms, objects, areas, etc. (See '%g%l%<builder%>%x'.)

Your private E-mail address can only be seen by yourself and the adminstrators of %@%m, and will be kept %r%l%fSTRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL%x.  An %c%lanonymous%x or %c%lforwarding%x E-mail address (Widely available on the Internet) %y%l%ucannot%x be accepted as a valid private E-mail address.  Please set your private E-mail address to your %m%lREAL%x E-mail address.

%PAGE
You can set your private E-mail address by typing '%g%l@email private <EMAIL ADDRESS>%x', for example, if your E-mail address is '%y%lfred@wibble.wobble.com%x', you can set your E-mail to this address by typing '%g%l@email private fred@wibble.wobble.com%x'.

If your private E-mail address is already set, you will not be able to change or reset it.  If it is incorrect, please ask an administrator to change it for you (Type '%g%l%(who%) admin%x' (See '%g%l%<who%>%x') for a list of currently connected administrators.)


%c%l%$Your public E-mail addresses
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIn addition to your private E-mail address, you may set up to four public E-mail addresses, which other users will be able to see and use to contact you if they wish to do so.  Your public E-mail addresses will appear on your '%g%l%(scan%)%x' and '%g%l%(profile%)%x' (See '%g%l%<scan%>%x' and '%g%l%<profile%>%x'.)

%PAGE
Unlike your private E-mail address, you may freely use anonymous or forwarding E-mail addresses for any of your public E-mail addresses.  You may also change or reset any of your public E-mail addresses as often as you wish.

To set your first public E-mail address, simply type '%g%l@email public <EMAIL ADDRESS>%x', e.g:  '%g%l@email public fred@anonymous.email.com%x'.  To set your other public E-mail addresses, simply type '%g%l@email <NUMBER> <EMAIL ADDRESS>%x', where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is a number between %c%l3%x and %c%l5%x (%y%l1%x is your first public E-mail address, and %y%l2%x is your private E-mail address), e.g:  '%g%l@email 3 fred@email.forward.com%x'.

To reset any of your public E-mail addresses, simply type '%g%l@email public reset%x' (To reset your first public E-mail address) or '%g%l@email <NUMBER> reset%x', where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the number of the public E-mail address you wish to reset (A number between %c%l3%x and %c%l5%x.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$The E-mail forwarding facility...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIf your private E-mail address is set correctly, you will also be able to take part in the E-mail forwarding facility built into %@%m.

This will give you an E-mail forwarding address along the lines of '%y%l%{@?lower "{%@%m}"}.user.name@%@%f%x'.  For example, if your name on %@%m was '%y%lFred Bloggs%x', your E-mail forwarding address would be '%y%lfred.bloggs@%@%f%x'.

If you do not wish to initially give your real E-mail address to other users, you can give them your forwarding E-mail address, through which they will be able to send an E-mail to you, without knowing your real E-mail address.

By default, your first public E-mail address will be used as the destination for E-mail sent to your E-mail forwarding address.  However, you can alternatively use your private E-mail address instead, by typing '%g%l@email public forward%x'.  If you do this, you can disable it again by setting (Or resetting your first public E-mail address.)

%PAGE
%c%l%8NOTE:  %xYour E-mail forwarding address will be your %@%m character name (Excluding prefix/suffix) in lowercase with spaces replaced by '%y%l.%x's, e.g:  '%y%lFred Bloggs%x' will be '%y%lfred.bloggs@%@%f%x', '%y%lJC Digita%x' will be '%y%ljc.digita@%@%f%x', etc.

       %xFor E-mail forwarding to work, your private E-mail address must be set.

       %xPlease allow 24 hours for E-mail address changes to take effect (The E-mail forwarding database is updated once daily.)

%9%4%c%lIMPORTANT:  %xWhen your E-mail forwarding address is available, it will appear in your '%g%l%(scan%)%x' and '%g%l%(profile%)%x' (See '%g%l%<scan%>%x' and '%g%l%<profile%>%x'.)  Please don't set any your E-mail addresses to your forwarding E-mail address (This excludes typing '%g%l@email public forward%x'), otherwise the forwarding may no-longer work.

A large number of commands and query commands (See '%g%l%<queries%>%x') return a value of either '%y%lOK%x' or '%y%lError%x' to indicate %c%lsuccess%x or %c%lfailure%x appropriately.

Success/failure is returned internally for all commands, regardless of whether they return '%y%lOK%x'/'%y%lError%x' as their return value or something different (As in the case of many query commands.)

Conditional commands such as '%g%l%(@if%)%x' and '%g%l%(@while%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@if%>%x' and '%g%l%<@while%>%x') rely on this result, as do the success/failure links of a compound command (See '%g%l%<@csuccess%>%x' and '%g%l%<@cfailure%>%x'.)

'%g%l{@eval}%x' returns the result of calculating %y%l<EXPRESSION>%x, which can be string, numeric or both.  Most standard comparison, arithmetic, logical and bitwise operators are supported (Including C programming language style ones.)

The result returned by '%g%l{@eval}%x' is usually numeric when doing comparisons, with '%y%l1%x' meaning %c%lTRUE%x and '%y%l0%x' meaning %c%lFALSE%x.  Within compound commands, you will usually use '%g%l{@eval}%x' in conjunction with a selection command such as '%g%l%(@if%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@if%>%x')  -  The general format for this is '%g%l%(@if%) {@eval <EXPRESSION>} do <COMMAND>[; else <COMMAND>]%x'.

Parentheses (Brackets) can be used to group subexpressions.  Precedence is %c%lSTRICTLY LEFT-TO-RIGHT%x, e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) {@eval 3 * 5 - 1}%x' gives '%y%l14%x' and '%g%l%(@echo%) {@eval 3 * (5 - 1)}%x' gives '%y%l12%x' (You don't have to separate the operators with spaces, however it does look neater and more readable.)

%8%c%lNOTE:  %xEnclose %c%lALL%x string parameters in double-quotes (%y%l""%x), e.g:  '%g%l%(@if%) {@eval "$1" = "Hello"} do %c...%x'

       %8%c%lDON'T%x enclose numeric parameters in double-quotes, or they'll be taken as strings, and numeric operations on them will fail.  E.g: '%g%l%(@if%) {@eval $1 = 15} do %c...%x'

Floating point numbers can be rounded to a number of decimal places by using '%g%l<DP>:<NUMBER>%x', where %y%l<DP>%x is the number of decimal places to round to, and %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the floating point number, e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) {@eval 2:3.4561}%x' gives '%y%l3.46%x'.

You can round the result of an entire calculation to a given number of decimal places by doing '%g%l{@eval <DP>:(<EXPRESSION>)}%x', e.g:  '%g%l%(@echo%) {@eval 3:(2.14523 + 1.78291 + 5.4382)}%x' gives '%y%l9.366%x'.

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@expiry%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@expiry <OBJECT> [= <TIME>]%]%x

This command is used to set an expiry time (In days) on an object, or reset its expiry time.  %@%n checks the entire database for expired objects on a weekly basis (An object expires when its last used date is greater than the number of days allowed for the object's expiry time.)

If %y%l<TIME>%x is specified, %y%l<OBJECT>%x's expiry time will be set to that number of days, which may be any number between %c%l1%x and %c%l255%x.  If %y%l<TIME>%x is omitted, the expiry time on %y%l<OBJECT>%x will be reset.

By default, the expiry time of an object is based on its last used date, but if the %y%l%(EXPIRY%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<expiry flag%>%x') is set on the object, the expiry time will be based on its %c%lcreation date%x instead.  This means that the object will expire after the specified amount of time, regardless of whether its being used or not.

%PAGE
A global expiry time will usually be set on the entire database, but this will usually be at least 1 year (The global expiry time will override any individual expiry times.)

One of the major uses of expiry times is when object(s) are created by a compound command which is used by users (Creating individual objects each time.)  If a low expiry time (I.e:  %c%l7 days%x (1 week) or %c%l30 days%x (Approx. 1 month) is set on these objects, they will be quickly destroyed if they are no-longer being used, or have been dropped in an obscure location which will be rarely visited.

For example, you have a shop where items can be bought (With the items being created and given to the 'customers'.)  As these items would have very little functionality, and would serve no other purpose other than to clutter the database up with useless objects (In time), a low expiry time could be set on the object when it is created, so if it is dropped somewhere obscure, or never looked at again by its purchaser, it will be destroyed automatically.

An object fails when a character fails to satisfy its lock (If it's a room, thing or exit), or if it's a compound command, it fails when the last command executed in it fails.

If the object fails, the failure message is displayed on the screen of the character who caused it to fail.

This command only has effect within a compound command.  It basically causes the compound command to fail at that point.

One use for it is right at the end of a compound command to force it to fail and execute the compound command linked via its '%g%l%(@cfail%)%x' regardless of whether the other commands executed failed or not.

You can list the available feelings by typing '%g%l@feeling list%x'.  You can then set how you are currently feeling by typing '%g%l@feeling <FEELING>%x', where %y%l<FEELING>%x is one of the feelings in the list, e.g:  '%g%l@feeling happy%x'.

If more than one page of feelings is displayed, you can view the other pages by typing '%g%l@feeling list <PAGE NO>%x', where %y%l<PAGE NO>%x is the page number, e.g:  '%g%l@feeling list 2%x' to view the %c%l2nd%x page, '%g%l@feeling list 3%x' to view the %c%l3rd%x.

             [<COMMANDS>]
        [%(@end%)]%]%x

The '%g%l@for%x' command can be used in two forms:  The first form may only be used on a %c%lSINGLE LINE%x.  '%g%l@for%x' starts at %y%l<FROM VALUE>%x and loops to %y%l<TO VALUE>%x, increasing/decreasing by %c%l1%x (Or %y%l<STEP VALUE>%x, if specified) each time and executing %y%l<COMMAND>%x.

%[%c%lExample:  %g%l@for 3 to 7 do %(@echo%) Loop value:  $4%]%x

%PAGE
The reserved variables %y%l$4%x and %y%l$5%x are useful in an '%g%l@for%x' statement  -  These substitute the following...

%y%l$4%x substitutes the current loop value.
%y%l$5%x substitutes the total number of loops so far.

%8%c%lNOTE:  %x'%g%l@for%x' can only be used from within compound commands (Unless you're an %r%lExperienced Builder%x or above.)

The second form of '%g%l@for%x' allows you to execute a 'block' of commands.

When using '%g%l@for%x' in this form, it %c%lMUST%x be spread over multiple lines and terminated with '%g%l%(@end%)%x'.  '%g%l@for%x' and '%g%l%(@end%)%x' %c%lMUST NOT%x be preceeded by any text other than blank space, or used within %y%l{}%x's (I.e:  '%g%l{@for ...}%x'.)  The '%y%ldo%x' keyword %c%lMUST NOT%x be followed with a %y%l<COMMAND>%x.

%PAGE
The usage of '%g%l@for%x' in this form is identical to the single lined version of '%g%l@for%x', except it is spread over multiple lines, e.g:

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@fuse <NAME> [= <COMMAND>]%]%x

Creates a fuse called %y%l<NAME>%x (Building Quota used:  %c%l5%x.)  If %y%l<COMMAND>%x is specified, the %c%lcsuccess%x ('%g%l%(@csucc%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@csucc%>%x') of the fuse will be set to the compound command %y%l<COMMAND>%x.

A fuse starts off %c%lattached to you%x (When you create it), but it can be attached to another character (Providing they're below your level) or a room, thing or exit (Use '%g%l%(@tel%) <FUSE> = <OBJECT>%x' to attach a fuse to an object.)  The conditions which cause a fuse to 'trigger' depend on the type of object it's attached to...

%9%4%y%lCHARACTER:%x  The fuse 'triggers' each time the character types a command or moves.

  %9%4%y%lVEHICLE:%x  The fuse 'triggers' each time the vehicle is driven/ridden.  If the vehicle can be entered and a character is inside it, the same conditions that apply to a room also apply to the vehicle.

%PAGE
    %9%4%y%lTHING:%x  The fuse 'triggers' each time the thing is picked up, dropped or successfully opened, closed, locked or unlocked.  If the thing is a container, which can be entered, and a character is inside it, the same conditions that apply to a room also apply to the container.

     %9%4%y%lROOM:%x  The fuse 'triggers' each time a character in the room types a command or moves.

     %9%4%y%lEXIT:%x  The fuse 'triggers' each time a character goes through the exit, or (In the case of %y%l%(OPENABLE%)%x exits (See '%g%l%<openable flag%>%x')) the exit is successfully opened, closed, locked or unlocked.

%PAGE
Whenever a fuse is 'triggered', the value stored in its %c%ldescription%x ('%g%l%(@desc%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@desc%>%x') counts down by 1.  If the resulting value is greater than 0, the compound command linked via the fuses %c%lcfailure%x ('%g%l%(@cfail%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@cfail%>%x') will be executed, otherwise the compound command linked via its %c%lcsuccess%x ('%g%l%(@csucc%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@csucc%>%x') will be executed and the %c%ldescription%x of the fuse will be reset to the value held in its %c%ldrop message%x ('%g%l%(@drop%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@drop%>%x'.)

You can make fuses attached to rooms/characters 'trigger' %c%lonly when movement occurs%x (I.e:  When characters move into/out of the room, or the character the fuse is attached to moves) by setting the %y%l%(TOM%)%x flag on them (Which stands for '%c%lTrigger On Movement%x'), e.g:  '%g%l%(@set%) <FUSE> = %(TOM%)%x'.

You can delay the 'triggering' of a fuse until the command which the user who triggered it typed has finished executing by setting the %y%l%(STICKY%)%x flag on it (E.g:  A %y%l%(TOM%)%x and %y%l%(STICKY%)%x fuse in a room will not trigger until a character moves in that room and has arrived in their destination room.)

%PAGE
When a compound command is executed by a fuse, %y%l$1%x is set to the command the character who triggered the fuse typed (E.g:  '%g%l%(say%)%x') and %y%l$2%x is set to the command's parameters (E.g:  '%g%lHello%x'.)  %y%l$3%x is set to both (E.g:  '%g%l%(say%) Hello%x'.)

%y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above can set the %y%l%(ABORT%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<abort flag%>%x') on a fuse, which prevents the command which triggered the fuse from being executed.  For example, a fuse attached to a thing with its %y%l%(ABORT%)%x flag set would cause the fuse to trigger each time the object was picked up or dropped.  However, the '%g%l%(take%)%x'/'%g%l%(drop%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<take%>%x' and '%g%l%<drop%>%x') would be aborted by the fuse, and the object would remain in the same place.  The '%g%l%(@continue%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@continue%>%x') can be used within the compound command executed by the fuse to prevent the effects of the %y%l%(ABORT%)%x flag.

%9%5%c%lFUSES HINT:%x  After creating a fuse, teleport it to the object you want to attach it to first ('%g%l%(@tel%) <FUSE> = <OBJECT>%x') and then set its drop message (%c%lReset%x) and description (%c%lTicks%x.)  Finally link the '%g%l%(@csucc%)%x' and/or '%g%l%(@cfail%)%x' to the appropriate compound command(s).

This command can only be used from within compound commands.

'%g%l@goto%x' skips/backtracks to the given %y%l<LINE NUMBER>%x in the current compound command and continues execution from that line number.  %y%l<LINE NUMBER>%x can either be literal (E.g:  '%g%l@goto 2%x' will go to line number %c%l2%x), or an adjustment (If '%y%l+%x' or '%y%l-%x' is used in front of %y%l<LINE NUMBER>%x), e.g:  '%g%l@goto +2%x' will skip executing the next line in the compound command and execute the line which follows, and '%g%l@goto -1%x' will execute the previous line (%r%lWARNING:  %xThis will create a loop), etc.

%TOPIC @heal
%TITLE Help on '%w%l@heal%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@heal <NAME> = [+/-]<HEALTH>%]%x

This command can only be used from within a compound command with its %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<combat flag%>%x'), in a location which also has its %y%l%(COMBAT%)%x flag set.  Both must be owned by the same character.

'%g%l@heal%x' increases (Or decreases, if a negative value is specified for %y%l<HEALTH>%x) the character %y%l<NAME>%x's health by %y%l<HEALTH>%x and is ideal for creating 'food', first-aid kits, poison, etc.  E.g:  '%g%l@heal *fred = 10%x' will increase the character "%c%lFred%x"'s health by %y%l10%x.

Usually, a character's health can't exceed %c%l100%%%x, however preceeding %y%l<HEALTH>%x with a '%y%l+%x' (Which can only be used in a compound command set %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x or %y%l%(ELDER%)%x (See '%g%l%<wizard flag%>%x' and '%g%l%<elder flag%>%x')) allows the character's health to be increased to a value higher than 100%.  '%y%l+%x' is ideal for creating special health power-ups, etc.  Health above 100% automatically decreases back down to 100% at a rate similar to healing when below 100%.

%PAGE
%c%l%8NOTE:  %x'%g%l@heal%x' cannot be used on yourself if you own the compound command or location in which it is used, or the character %y%l<NAME>%x is not in the same location as you.

Creates/re-creates your home room, if you do not already have one, or you have accidentally destroyed it.

If you are a Builder (See '%g%l%<builder%>%x'), you must have sufficient free Building Quota (See '%g%l%<@quota%>%x') to create your home room.

Once created, you can go to your home room by typing '%g%l%(homeroom%)%x', '%g%l%(home%)%x' (If your home room is your current home, or '%g%l%(home%)%x' %c%ltwice%x if not.)

%PAGE
While you are in your home room, you can change its %c%lname%x by using the '%g%l%(@name%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@name%>%x'), e.g:

   %3%[%g%l%(@name%) here = Fred's House%]%x

You can also change the %c%ldescription%x, using the '%g%l%(@desc%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@desc%>%x') command ('%g%l%(@describe%)%x'), e.g:

   %3%[%g%l%(@desc%) here = Welcome to my home room.  Feel free to make yourself at home.%]%x

You can also use the editor (See '%g%l%<editor%>%x') to edit the description of your home room (This is useful for creating long descriptions, correcting mistakes or making changes without having to type the description all over again.)

%PAGE
You can change the '%y%l%uContents:%x' title to something more interesting using the '%g%l%(@cstring%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@cstring%>%x'), e.g:

   %3%[%g%l%(@cstring%) here = In the room you see:%]%x

By setting the %y%l%(ABODE%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<abode flag%>%x'), you can allow other characters to visit your home room whenever they please (Using the '%g%l%(visit%)%x' or '%g%l%(to%)%x' commands (See '%g%l%<visit%>%x' and '%g%l%<to%>%x'), without you having to summon them using the '%g%l%(summon%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<summon%>%x')), e.g:

The %y%l<CONDITION>%x part of an '%g%l%(@if%)%x', '%g%l%(@else%)%x' or '%g%l%(@while%)%x' statement can be in any of the following four formats...

%[%g%l#<COMMAND ID>            %c%l...E.g:  %g%l@if #34 do @echo Success!; else @echo Fail!
{%(@eval%) <EXPRESSION>}     %c%l...E.g:  %g%l@if {@eval 1 < 3} do @echo 1 is less than 3!

<COMMAND>                %c%l...E.g:  %g%l@if @true do @echo Always true!%]%x

In the first form, whether %y%l<CONDITION>%x is met or not is determined by whether the compound command %y%l#<ID>%x returns success or failure when executed.  In the second, whether %y%l<CONDITION>%x is met or not depends on the result of the expression evaluated with '%g%l%(@eval%)%x'.  In the third form, it's determined by the result of the given query command (See '%g%l%<queries%>%x') and in the last form, it's determined by whether %y%l<COMMAND>%x (Which can be either in-built or compound) returns success or failure.

By default, if %y%l<CONDITION>%x is met, %y%l<COMMAND1>%x will be executed, otherwise %y%l<COMMAND2>%x (The '%y%lelse%x' part) will be executed (If specified.)  If the keyword '%y%lfalse%x' is specified, the '%g%l@if%x' is negated (I.e:  %y%l<COMMAND1>%x will be executed if %y%l<CONDITION> %c%lISN'T%x met, otherwise %y%l<COMMAND2>%x will be executed (If specified.)

%PAGE
%[%c%lExample:  %g%l@if {%(@?set%) me = haven} do %(@echo%) You are set HAVEN.; else %(@echo%) You
          are not set HAVEN.%]%x

The second form of '%g%l@if%x' is far more flexible and sophisticated, allowing you to execute 'blocks' of commands, and have multiple conditional '%g%l%(@else%)%x' blocks (This effectively allows '%g%l@if%x' to be used like a 'case' statement (As found in many programming languages.))

When using '%g%l@if%x' in this form, it %c%lMUST%x be spread over multiple lines and terminated with '%g%l%(@end%)%x'.  '%g%l@if%x', '%g%l%(@else%)%x' and '%g%l%(@end%)%x' %c%lMUST NOT%x be preceeded by any text other than blank space, or used within %y%l{}%x's (I.e:  '%g%l{@if ...}%x'.)

    %(@oemote%) suddenly realises that %%s's male!
%(@else%)
    %(@echo%) You are female.
    %(@oemote%) suddenly realises that %%s's female!
%(@end%)%]

%PAGE
In the above '%g%l@if%x' statement, you will notice that there are %c%lTWO%x '%g%l%(@else%)%x' parts.  This is a useful feature of the multiple lined version of '%g%l@if%x':  In the above example, if you're not set %y%l%(NEUTER%)%x, it will then test to see if you're set %y%l%(MALE%)%x.  It's effectively the same as '%g%l@if {%(@?set%) me = neuter} do %(@echo%) You are neuter.; else @if {%(@?set%) me = male} do %(@echo%) You are male.; else %(@echo%) You are female.%x' (%c%lNOTE:  %xThe '%g%l%(@oemote%)%x's are ommitted for simplicity and readability.)

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@link <OBJECT> = <HOME OBJECT>
        @link <EXIT> = <DESTINATION>%]%x

The first form ('%g%l@link <OBJECT> = <HOME OBJECT>%x') is used to set the home of a character or thing, or set the drop-to of a room.  You can set your home (Which is the room/container you return to when you type '%g%l%(home%)%x') by typing '%g%l@link me = #<ROOM ID>%x'.

If a thing has it's %y%l%(STICKY%)%x flag set, it will return to its home when dropped.  The drop-to of a room is the location where all objects dropped in the room will be teleported to (If the room has its %y%l%(STICKY%)%x flag set, the drop-to will be delayed until there are no connected characters in the room.)

%PAGE
The second form ('%g%l@link <EXIT> = <DESTINATION>%x') is used to set the destination of an exit, which must be a room or container.  If you're a Builder or above, you can link exits which don't belong to you (In doing this, you take over the ownership and Building Quota used by it.)

You can unlink an exit or remove the drop-to of a room by using the '%g%l%(@unlink%)%x' command.

%9%3%c%lExamples:  %x'%g%l@link me = #12345%x', '%g%l@link mything = #12345%x', '%g%l@link here = #12345%x', '%g%l@link myexit = #12345%x', etc.

'%g%l@list%x' is used to list objects of given type(s) that belong to you, the specified character, or are within the given object.

If %y%l<PAGE NO>%x is specified, the list of objects will be split into pages and the page number specified will be displayed (Useful for long lists.)

%y%l<SEARCH ITEM>%x can be one of the following...

%9%7%g%l(1)  %c%lme%x        Lists objects belonging to you.

%9%7%g%l(2)  %c%l#<ID>%x     Lists objects belonging to you that are within the object %y%l#<ID>%x (I.e:  %y%l#<ID>%x should be a room or container.)

%9%7%g%l(3)  %c%l*<NAME>%x   Lists objects belonging to the character %y%l<NAME>%x.

%9%7%g%l(4)  %c%lall%x       Lists every object in the database (Of specified type(s).)

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@lock%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@lock <OBJECT> = <KEY>%]%x

Locks %y%l<OBJECT>%x so that the lock specification %y%l<KEY>%x must be satisfied before the object can be used successfully.  %y%l<OBJECT>%x can be an %c%lCompound Command%x, %c%lExit%x, %c%lFuse%x, %c%lThing%x or %c%lRoom%x.

A lock specification consists of one or more conditions, linked together using boolean operators such as %c%lAND%x/%c%lOR%x and parentheses %c%l()%x for grouping. 

%PAGE

%c%l%$Conditions may be any of the following:
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%m%lCharacters  %c-  %xOnly those specified will satisfy the lock specification, e.g:
%y%l*<NAME>        %x'%g%l%(@lock%) JC Digita's Object = *jcdigita%x'

%m%lObjects     %c-  %xOnly characters carrying the specified object(s) will be able
%y%l<NAME>         %xto satisfy the lock specification, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Lockable Exit
%y%l#<ID>          %g%l= Key%x'

%m%lFlags	    %c-  %xOnly characters with the specified flag(s) set will be able
%y%l@<FLAG>        %xto satisfy the lock specification, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Admin only
               exit = @%(apprentice%)'%]%x

%PAGE

%[%c%l%$Boolean Operators
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%9%5%y%l!  %m(%m%lNOT%m)  %c-  %xReverse condition, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Box = !*JC Digita%x' will prevent %y%lJC Digita%x from picking up the object '%y%lBox%x'.

%9%5%y%l&  %m(%m%lAND%m)  %c-  %xBoth conditions must be met to satisfy the lock, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Secure Exit = Key1&Key2%x' will prevent anyone going through it unless they are carrying the objects '%y%lKey1%x' %c%l%uAND%x '%y%lKey2%x'.

%9%5%y%l|  %m(%m%lOR%m)   %c-  %xEither condition must be met to satisfy the lock, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Exit for Joe or Fred = *Joe|*Fred%x' will allow the users %y%lJoe %c%l%uOR%x %y%lFred%x to go through the exit.%]%x

%PAGE

%c%l%$Parentheses ()
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xParentheses are used to group expressions, in a similar manner to arithmetic equations.  For example, if you wanted to make it so only male or female characters who are carrying the object '%y%lKey%x' can pass through an exit, you would use '%g%l%(@lock%) Exit = (@%(male%)|@%(female%))&Key%x' as the lock specification.


%c%l%$How locks affect different types of objects
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%9%4%y%lCommand  %c-  %xA locked compound command can only be executed by characters who satisfy its lock, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) AdminCmd = @%(apprentice%)%x' allows only %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above to execute the compound command '%y%lAdminCmd%x'.

%PAGE
%9%4%y%lExit     %c-  %xA locked exit can only be used by characters who satisfy its lock, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Admin Exit = @%(apprentice%)%x' will only allow %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above to pass through the exit.

            %9%4Alternatively, if the exit has its %y%l%(OPENABLE%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<openable flag%>%x'), the lock will determine who may open, close, lock and unlock the exit.  While the exit is open, %c%l%uANYBODY%x will be able to go through it even if they don't satisfy the lock.  When using exits that can be opened, closed, locked and unlocked, it's worthwhile setting the %y%l%(STICKY%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<sticky flag%>%x') on the exit too, so that it will automatically close and lock itself again once a user has gone through it.

%9%4%y%lFuse     %c-  %xA locked fuse will only be triggered by characters who satisfy its lock, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Test Fuse = *Fred%x' will make '%y%lTest Fuse%x' trigger for the character '%y%lFred%x' only.

%PAGE
%9%4%y%lRoom     %c-  %xA locked room will determine who can see the room's success and failure messages.  This allows you to add extra information to the room's description based on whether the lock is satisfied or not, e.g:

%[            %g%l%(@lock%) here = Key
            %(@succ%) here = The way out is blocked by a large door with a
               strong lock.  Perhaps you should try and find a key that
               will open it.
            %(@fail%) here = The way out is blocked by a large door with a strong
               lock.  Perhaps that key you picked up will open it?%]%x

            %9%4Alternatively, if the room has its %y%l%(OPENABLE%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<openable flag%>%x', the lock will determine who may enter the room, allowing you to keep unwanted characters out of it, even if it has its %y%l%(ABODE%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<abode flag%>%x'.)  For example, '%g%l%(@set%) here = !enterable%x' and '%g%l%(@lock%) here = !*Joe%x' will prevent the character '%y%lJoe%x' from entering your current location.

%PAGE
            %9%4In this case, the success message (See '%g%l%<@succ%>%x') will be displayed to characters who are able to successfully enter the room (The others succcess message (See '%g%l%<@osucc%>%x') is displayed to everyone else in the room.)

            %9%4The failure message (See '%g%l%<@fail%>%x') is displayed to characters who are unable to enter the room (The others failure message (See '%g%l%<@ofail%>%x') is displayed to everyone else in their current location.)

%9%4%y%lThing    %c-  %xA locked thing can only be picked up by characters who satisfy its lock, e.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) Fred's Object = *Fred%x' will only allow the character '%y%lFred%x' to pick up '%y%lFred's Object%x'.  You can prevent anybody from picking up an object by using '%g%lme&!me%x' as the lock specification.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Success/Failure messages
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xOn compound commands, exits, things and rooms, the success and failure messages are displayed depending on whether the lock specification was satisfied or not.  These can be used to display appropriate messages to the user ('%g%l%(@succ%)%x' and '%g%l%(@fail%)%x') and other users in the same location ('%g%l%(@osucc%)%x' and '%g%l%(@ofail%)%x'.)

For further information on success and failure messages, please see '%g%l%<@succ%>%x', '%g%l%<@osucc%>%x', '%g%l%<@fail%>%x', '%g%l%<@ofail%>%x', '%g%l%<@drop%>%x' and '%g%l%<@odrop%>%x'.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@log [<LOGFILE>] [= reset|reopen]
        @log [<LOGFILE>] [= <PAGE>]
        @log list%]%x

The '%g%l@log%x' command is used to view your own user log file, or the various system log files maintained by %@%m (This can only be done by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.)

Every Builder and above has their own log file, which records when they connect/disconnect and unrecognised commands typed by users in their rooms/areas (Providing they are not of a higher level.)  Customised entries can also be written to the log file using '%g%l%(@logentry%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@logentry%>%x'.)

%y%l<LOGFILE>%x is the name of the log file to view.  If this is omitted, or '%y%lme%x' is specified, your log file will be viewed.  '%y%l*<NAME>%x' or '%y%l#<ID>%x' can be specified to view the log file of another character (Providing you are of a higher level than them.)

%PAGE
Any other name (Without '%y%l*%x' or '%y%l#%x' in front) will view %@%m system log files, if you have permission to do so (%y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above only.)  Type '%g%l@log list%x' to see a list of available system log files.

If %y%l<PAGE>%x is omitted, the most recent entries are displayed, otherwise the log file is back-tracked by %y%l<PAGE>%x pages and entries from that page are displayed, e.g:  '%g%l@log admin = 1%x' back-tracks the '%y%lAdmin%x' log file by %c%l1 page%x and lists the entries on that page.

You can reset your log file by type '%g%l@log = reset%x'.  %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above can reset the log file of a lower level character by typing '%g%l@log *<NAME> = reset%x' or '%g%l@log #<ID> = reset%x'.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xNo backups are made of user log files.  If you reset your log file, you will lose everything that was logged in it %r%lpermanently%x.

%PAGE
%m%lDeities%x and the %m%lSupreme Being%x may reset a %@%m system log file by typing '%g%l@log <LOGFILE> = reset%x' (The log file is moved to '%y%l<LOG FILENAME>.backup%x' and a new empty log file is created.)

A log file may also be re-opened using '%g%l@log <LOGFILE> = reopen%x' (If it is normally kept open, such as the '%c%lConnect%x' log file.)

%TITLE Help on '%w%l@logentry%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@logentry [<LOGFILE>] = <TITLE> = <ENTRY>%]%x

The '%g%l@logentry%x' command is used to make custom entries to user and %@%m system log files.  This can only be done from within a compound command.

Every Builder and above has their own log file, which records when they connect/disconnect and unrecognised commands typed by users in their rooms/areas (Providing they are not of a higher level.)  Customised entries can also be written to the log file using '%g%l@logentry%x'.

%y%l<LOGFILE>%x is the name of the log file to make a custom entry to.  If this is omitted, or '%y%lme%x' is specified, the entry will be made to your log file.  For a list of %@%m system log files, type '%g%l%(@log%) list%x' (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'.)

%PAGE
'%y%l*<NAME>%x' or '%y%l#<ID>%x' can be specified to make a custom entry to the log file of another character (To do this, you must have write permission to them, and the '%g%l@logentry%x' must be done under your '%g%l%(@chpid%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@chpid%>%x') within the compound command.)

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xCustom entries can only be made to %@%m system log files within a compound command with its %y%l%(^flag WIZARD%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<wizard flag%>%x'), owned by an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above and under their '%g%l%(@chpid%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@chpid%>%x'.)

%y%l<TITLE>%x is the title of the log file entry, which must not exceed %c%l15 characters%x in length, and may only consist of alphanumeric text.

%y%l<ENTRY>%x is the text of the log file entry.

%PAGE
%c%l%8NOTE:  %x%(ANSI%) colour and text formatting codes are stripped from all custom log file entries, and the %y%l<TITLE>%x is automatically capitalised.

When viewing log files using '%g%l%(@log%)%x' (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'), custom entries appear with a yellow title enclosed in '%y%l[]%x', e.g:  '%y%l[TITLE]:%x'.

Details of all custom log file entries made are logged to the '%y%lLogEntry%x' log file (Unless you are making a custom entry to your own log file from within one of your compound commands.)


%c%l%$Example:
%~%c~~~~~~~~
%[%g%l@logentry me = MY TEST = This is a test entry in my log file.
@logentry misc = TEST = This is a test entry in the 'Misc' system log file.

This command allows %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above to monitor an abusive/problem user to obtain evidence and take appropriate action against them.

When monitored, every command the user types will be logged to the '%c%lMonitor%x' log file (See '%g%l%<@log%>%x'.)  When the parameter '%y%lcommands%x' or '%y%lboth%x' is specified, every command typed by the user will also be relayed to the member of Admin monitoring them.

If the parameter '%y%loutput%x' or '%y%lboth%x' is specified, all output (As seen by the monitored user, on their screen) will be relayed to the member of Admin monitoring them.  %c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xRelayed output appears %m%lEXACTLY%x how it does on the monitored user's screen, so don't be surprised if you suddenly start saying things, sending pages, etc. (That is the monitored user speaking, paging, etc., %r%lNOT%x you.)

You can use '%g%l@name%x' to change your name by typing '%g%l@name me = <NAME>%x'.

'%g%l@namelower%x' allows an object with its article set (See '%g%l%<articles%>%x') to be given a lower-case name, allowing an object to be called '%y%lA television%x' instead of '%y%lA Television%x' for example, if it had the %y%l%(CONSONANT%)%x article.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@sanity checklists|fixlists [= yes]
        @sanity general [= yes]%]%x

'%g%l@sanity%x' is used to perform integrity checks on the database, to check for (And optionally attempt to correct) possible corruption.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xA general sanity check is always performed automatically when %@%m starts up, and a full sanity check ('%y%lfixlists%x') is also performed if %@%m was not shutdown 'cleanly' (I.e:  Using the '%g%l%(@shutdown%)%x' command  -  See '%g%l%<@shutdown%>%x'.)  Because of this, manual use of the '%g%l@sanity%x' command should be unnecessary.

'%g%l@sanity checklists%x' (Which can only be used by %g%lElder Wizards/%gDruids%x and above) checks for corrupted linked lists attached to objects and '%g%l@sanity fixlists%x' (Which can only be used by %m%lDeities%x and the %m%lSupreme Being%x) attempts to fix any corruption.

%PAGE
'%g%l@sanity general%x' performs a general sanity check on the database.  This will check for and fix simple problems, such as objects with invalid owners, etc.  This check is also performed automatically on start-up, and could cause lag (For this reason, the second parameter '%y%lyes%x' must be given.)

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xBoth '%g%l@sanity checklists%x' and '%g%l@sanity fixlists%x' can be extremely CPU intensive and can take several minutes to complete (Depending on the size of the database, and server CPU power)  -  I.e:  %@%m could come to a complete halt for everyone using it until the command completes, so it should only ever be used in an %r%l%uabsolute emergency%x.  For these reasons, the second parameter '%y%lyes%x' must be given to use them.

Sites matching a particular IP address can be listed by specifying the IP address and (Optionally) using a '%y%l*%x' in place of any of the numbers in it, e.g:  '%g%l@site list 193.133.51.*%x' will list all sites with an IP address beginning '%y%l193.133.51%x'.

You can also list all sites with a description which matches the wildcard specification you give, e.g:  '%g%l@site list *leeds*%x' will list every site with the text '%y%lleeds%x' in its description.

%PAGE
You can list sites which only have particular Internet site flags set (Or not set), e.g:  '%g%l@site list = banned%x' will list all Internet sites which have been banned, '%g%l@site list = !create%x' will list all Internet sites which have been banned from creating new characters.

You may notice that some of the compression ratios (Especially for particular object types) are fairly low.  This is because only text (I.e:  Descriptions, etc.) can be compressed.  Integers, pointers and other object data cannot be compressed, but are taken into account by '%g%l@size%x'.  The text itself is often compressed with a ratio of 70%% or better.

Creates an exit with the name(s) specified (Separated by semicolons ('%y%l;%x')) (Building Quota used:  %c%l2%x.)

The first name is the full descriptive name of the exit (E.g:  '%y%lAn old wooden door%x') and is displayed in the '%y%l%$Obvious exits:%x' list of the room/container the exit's in.

The second name should be a short, abbreviated name for the exit (E.g:  '%y%lwooden%x'.)  -  This is displayed in brackets after the full descriptive name in the '%y%l%$Obvious exits:%x' list (E.g:  'An old wooden door (%g%lWooden%x)'.)  If your exit has '%y%lout%x', '%y%lback%x', '%y%lexit%x' or '%y%lleave%x' for one of its other names, this will used instead (They're standard.)

Any other names given to the exit should be the ones you think users may try to type to go through the exit (E.g:  '%y%lAn old wooden door;wooden;old;wooden door;an old;old wooden;old wooden door%x'.)

%PAGE
If %y%l<DESTINATION>%x is specified (Which must be the %y%l#<ID>%x of a room or container), the exit is linked to that room/container.

If %y%l<DESTINATION>%x isn't specified, the exit remains unlinked and can be linked using the command '%g%l%(@link%)%x'.  Unlinked exits can be linked by anyone (They become the new owner of the exit.)

The name of the exit can be changed at any time using '%g%l%(@name%)%x'.

There should be an exit in every room you build with the names '%y%lout;back;exit;leave%x' in its name, which are the standard exit names for leaving a room.  This exit should take you back to the room you expect to end up in when you leave the room.

%PAGE
By default, when an exit is created, you (And other users) will be able to see which room the exit leads to, e.g:

A Spiral Staircase (%g%l%$Up%x) leads to The Tower Top.

You can remove the '%y%lleads to <DESTINATION>%x' part by setting the %y%l%(OPAQUE%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<opaque flag%>%x') on the exit ('%g%l%(@set%) exit = %(OPAQUE%)%x'.)  This allows you to be more descriptive with your exit names, e.g:

By default, an exit is always open, and the characters who may go through the exit is determined by its lock (E.g:  '%g%l%(@lock%) <EXIT> = me|*fred%x' will only allow yourself and the character '%y%lFred%x' to go through the exit.)

%PAGE
However, an exit can be set so it can be opened, closed, locked and unlocked (Just like a container), using the '%g%l%(open%)%x', '%g%l%(close%)%x', '%g%l%(lock%)%x' and '%g%l%(unlock%)%x' commands respectively.  The lock of an exit like this determines who may lock/unlock the exit, and/or what key they require to do so (I.e:  '%g%l%(@thing%) Large doorkey%x', '%g%l%(@lock%) exit = large doorkey%x'  -  Only characters holding the object '%y%lLarge doorkey%x' may lock/unlock the exit.)

To make an exit so it can be opened, closed, locked and unlocked, you need to set its %y%l%(OPENABLE%)%x flag ('%g%l%(@set%) <EXIT> = openable%x'  -  See '%g%l%<openable flag%>%x'.)  You can also make it so the exit automatically closes after a character goes through it by setting its %y%l%(STICKY%)%x flag (E.g:  '%g%l%(@set%) <EXIT> = sticky%x'  -  See '%g%l%<sticky flag%>%x')  -  If the lock of the exit is set, the exit will also be automatically locked again too.

This command sets the others success message for the %y%l<OBJECT>%x specified.  You must of course control this object.

An object succeeds when a character manages to satisfy its lock (If it's a room, thing or exit), or if it's a compound command, it succeeds when the last command executed in it succeeds.

If the object succeeds, the others success message is displayed with the character's name in front on the screens of every character in the same room as the character who caused it to succeed.

%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xThe character who causes the others success message to be displayed %c%lWILL NOT%x see the others success message.  Instead, they will see the success message (See '%g%l%<@succ%>%x'), if set.

It's strongly recommended that you change your password from time to time to prevent unauthorised access to your character.  If someone manages to connect with your character, they're more than likely to do malicious things with it/to everything you've worked so hard to build.

%TITLE Help on '%w%lpay%x' (Or '%w%l@pay%x')
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l[@]pay <NAME> = <AMOUNT> [= account|pocket]%]%x

The '%g%lpay%x' command is used to perform transactions with other characters.  You can use it to pay credit into the pocket or bank account of another user.

%y%l<NAME>%x is the name of the user who you would like to pay and %y%l<AMOUNT>%x is the amount of credit you would like to pay to them.  For example, '%g%lpay fred bloggs = 10%x' will pay %c%l10 credits%x to the user %y%lFred Bloggs%x.

If '%y%laccount%x' is specified, the credit will be paid directly into the user %y%l<NAME>%x's bank account.  If
'%y%lpocket%x' is specified, the credit will be paid into the user's pocket.  If neither are specified, it will
be paid into the user's pocket by default (Or their bank account, if used within a compound command.)

You can also transfer credit to users directly from your bank account, by using the '%g%l%(transfer%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<transfer%>%x'.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Example use of '%w%l%$@pay%c%l%$' within compound commands...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xTo make a compound command which charges a user credit, simply place the following command at the beginning of your compound command, replacing %y%l<AMOUNT>%x with the amount of credits you would like to charge...

%[%g%l   %(@if%) false {@pay {%(@?owner%) {%(@?myself%)}} = <AMOUNT>} do %(@return%)%]%x

%9%4%r%lIMPORTANT:  %xIf you build compound commands which charge for their usage, you %m%l%f%uMUST%x inform the user that they will be charged and how much.  %r%lFailure to do this may result in the earnings you have unfairly earned being taken away from you.%x

For example, if you built a bar from which users could buy drinks, its description should be something like:

   %c%lA large bar, selling just about every drink you can think of.
   All drinks cost %w%l1.50 %c%lcredits.%x

%PAGE
...And the compound command which allows users to buy drinks should be something like:

%[%g%l   %(@if%) {%(@eval%) {%(@?credit%)} < 1.50} do
       %(@echo%) Sorry, you do not have enough credit to by yourself a drink.
       %(@return%)
   %(@end%)
   %(@if%) false {@pay {%(@?owner%) {%(@?myself%)}} = 1.50} do %(@return%)
   %(@echo%) You hand the bartender 1.50 credits and ask for a $1.
   %(@echo%) You down it in one go.
   %(@oemote%) orders a $1 from the bar and downs it in one.%]%x

%PAGE
You can also pay out money to users from within compound commands by using the '%g%l%(@force%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@force%>%x') to force yourself to pay the money to them, e.g:

%[%g%l   %(@force%) {%(@?owner%) {%(@?myself%)}} = @pay *{%(@?name%) me} = 10 = pocket%]%x

...Will pay 10 credits into the pocket of the user executing the compound command the above line is placed within.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xYou can guard against unwanted payments by using the '%g%l%(restrict%)%x' bank command (See '%g%l%<bank%>%x') to restrict the maximum payment you can make from within a compound command.

The '%g%ltransfer%x' command is used to perform transactions with other characters.  It's used to transfer credit directly from your bank account into the pocket or bank account of another user.

%y%l<NAME>%x is the name of the user who you would like to transfer credit to, and %y%l<AMOUNT>%x is the amount of credit you would like to transfer to them from from your bank account.  For example, '%g%ltransfer fred bloggs = 10 = account%x' will transfer %c%l10 credits%x from your bank account to to the user %y%lFred Bloggs%x's bank account.

%PAGE
%y%l<DIRECTION>%x is the direction of sorting, which can be either '%y%lascending%x' or '%y%ldescending%x'.  If this is omitted, '%y%ldescending%x' is assumed by default.

By default, the first page of users/objects will be displayed.  However, if %y%l<PAGE NO>%x is specified, that page of users/objects will be displayed, e.g:  '%g%l@rank 2 ...%x' to display the %c%l2nd%x page, '%g%l@rank 3 ...%x' to display the %c%l3rd%x, etc.  For example, '%g%l@rank 2 longest%x'.

'%g%l@rank%x' ranks every user/object in the database by default, however you can rank your friends list by typing '%g%l@rank ... = friends%x' or '%g%l@rank ... = enemies%x', and rank current administrators of %@%m by typing '%g%l@rank ... = admin%x'.  For example, '%g%l@rank longest = friends%x'.

You can see the position of an individual user/object by typing '%g%l@rank ... = <NAME>%x', e.g:  '%g%l@rank ... = me%x' will tell you where you are in the list (Out of all of the other characters in the database) and '%g%l@rank ... = fred bloggs%x' will tell you where the user '%y%lFred Bloggs%x' is in the list.  For example, '%g%l@rank longest = me%x'.

%PAGE
You can also list users/objects in a given range of positions by typing '%g%l@rank <FROM>-<TO> ...%x', e.g:  '%g%l@rank 100-150 longest%x' will list users/objects in the positions %y%l100%x to %y%l150%x (Ranked by longest connect time.)

Ranking objects is an ideal way to check for individual objects (Especially dynamic arrays) which are using an excessive amount of memory unnecessarily, or locations containing an excessive amount of credits.

Multiple types may be specified, i.e:  '%g%l@rank csize,things,rooms%x'.
%PAGE
%9%9%9%9%1Types can be any of the following:  %y%lalarms%x, %y%lall%x, %y%larrays%x, %y%lcharacters%x, %y%lcommands%x, %y%lexits%x, %y%lfuses%x, %y%lproperties%x, %y%lpuppets%x, %y%lrooms%x, %y%lthings%x, %y%lvariables%x.

When ranking objects in the above manner, %y%l<NAME>%x can be specified to see the position of an individual object in the list.  However, if the object is not in your current location, you will need to specify its %y%l#ID%x number instead of its name.

'%g%l@set%x' is used to set/reset one or more flags on an object or character.

To set a flag on an object, simply type '%g%l@set <OBJECT> = <FLAG>%x', e.g:  '%g%l@set myobject = sticky%x'.  To reset a flag, simply type '%g%l@set <OBJECT> = !<FLAG>%x' ('%y%l!%x' means '%y%lnot%x'.)  You can set/reset more than one flag on an object in one go by specifying multiple flag names separated by spaces, e.g:  '%g%l@set here = haven !abode !yell%x'.

When you look at an object you own/control, flags are displayed as letters following the ID number of it (E.g:  '%y%lThe Maelstrom(#3227 RAHy)%x'.)

%PAGE
The first flag (After the ID) (%y%lR%x) tells you what type the object is, e.g:  %y%lR%x = %c%lRoom%x.  This flag (Which is an %c%lobject type flag%x) can't be changed  -  Any other flags following this flag can (%y%lAHy%x), by using '%g%l@set%x'.

%TITLE Help on the %w%lABORT%x flag

This flag can only be set/reset by %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruids%x and above on fuses.

When set on a fuse, the %y%lABORT%x flag will prevent the command which triggered the fuse from being executed.  For example, if a fuse with its %y%lABORT%x flag set is placed on an object, then when a character attempts to pick up or drop the object, the fuse will be executed, but the object will remain where it is (Because the '%g%l%(take%)%x' or '%g%l%(drop%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<take%>%x' and '%g%l%<drop%>%x') typed by the user will be aborted.)

The '%g%l%(@continue%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@continue%>%x') can be used within the compound command executed by the fuse with its %y%lABORT%x flag set to optionally prevent the effects of the %y%lABORT%x flag (I.e:  Allow the execution of the command which triggered the fuse.)

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@set <OBJECT> = ASHCAN
        @set <OBJECT> = !ASHCAN%]%x

The %y%lASHCAN%x flag is used to mark objects for automatic destruction after their last usage date exceeds %c%l1 month%x.  Objects with their %y%lASHCAN%x flag set can be saved from automatic destruction by resetting their %y%lASHCAN%x flag.

The %y%lASHCAN%x flag is also set on any object/character which couldn't be destroyed by automatic object/character maintenance for some reason (I.e:  A Builder who has objects locked to them, an object used in the lock of another object, etc.)

%PAGE
%8%c%lNOTE:  %xIf you no-longer need an object, you should destroy it by using the '%g%l%(@destroy%)%x' command, as this will remove the object from the database immediately and reimburse the Building Quota used by it, so you can use it to build something else.

       %8You can recover accidentally destroyed objects by using the '%g%l%(@undestroy%)%x' command, however objects destroyed by automatic object maintenance cannot be recovered.

If a character's %y%lBBS%x flag is removed, they will no-longer be able to add new messages to %@%n BBS, reply to messages, delete messages, etc.  However, they will be able to still browse the BBS and read messages on it.

This flag can only be set/reset on characters.

If you set your %y%lBBS-INFORM%x flag ('%g%l%(@set%) me = bbs-inform%x'), you will receive messages informing you when other characters add, reply to, modify, etc. messages on %@%n BBS (Similar to the messages you get when you are in the BBS room.)

%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xThe %y%lBOOT%x flag is an alias for the %y%lBUILDER%x flag.

The Builder flag may be set/reset on characters by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

Builders have the same privileges as Mortals, except they may build their own locations, objects, compound commands, etc.  However, as a Builder, the amount you can build is limited by your Building Quota limit.  You can find out what your Building Quota limit is, and how much of it is in use at any time by typing '%g%l%(scan%) me%x'.

%PAGE
If you'd like to be a Builder, get in touch with an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above  -  You'll be given a %y%lBUILDER%x flag and will have a Building Quota of %c%l100%x to begin with.  You should use this to experiment with the different types of objects you can make and the various building commands.

If an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above's %y%lBOOT%x (%y%lBUILDER%x) flag is removed, they will no-longer be able to boot users (Using '%g%l%(@boot%)%x'  -  However, they may still use the '%g%l%(@bootdead%)%x' command to boot 'dead'/'locked-up' connections.)

%TITLE Help the %w%lBEING%x flag
%[%c%l%8USAGE:  %g%l@set *<NAME> = BEING

The %y%lBEING%x flag may be set on characters by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

A character with their %y%lBEING%x flag set will automatically be excluded from the '%g%l%(admin%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<adminlist%>%x'.)

This is useful for excluding users who are not true 'real' administrators (Although they have the appropriate rank), for example, an inactive %c%lWizard%x character who owns a global area and its associated commands, or an Admin-ranked 'puppet' used by an administrator for building purposes.

The %y%lBEING%x flag is also reserved for future use for virtual computer-controlled characters (Also referred to as  'monsters', 'robots', 'bots' and 'non-playing characters' (NPC's.))

%TITLE Help on the %w%lCENSORED%x flag
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@set <OBJECT> = CENSORED
        @set <OBJECT> = !CENSORED%]%x

This flag can be set on characters, rooms, things and compound commands.

The %y%lCENSORED%x flag controls whether bad language can be used within a location or by a particular character.

When rooms or things are set %y%lCENSORED%x, characters within them will not be able to use bad language (Attempts will be censored out with '%c%l*%x's.)  The %y%lCENSORED%x flag is ideal for public locations and talking rooms where you don't want people using bad language.

When characters are set %y%lCENSORED%x (This can only be done by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above), they will not be able to use bad language in %r%lANY%x location, regardless of whether it has its %y%l%(CENSORED%)%x flag set or not.  This is ideal for dealing with offensive/abusive users.

%PAGE
Compound commands default to having their %y%lCENSORED%x flag set.  This results in each command line within the compound command being subject to censorship when executed in a %y%lCENSORED%x location or by a %y%lCENSORED%x character.  This is ideal for communications compound commands, but can have adverse results within other compound commands.

%c%lWizards/%cDruids%x and above can reset the %y%lCENSORED%x flag on a compound command, allowing it to execute without being subject to censorship.  However, the command-line typed by the user to execute the compound command will still be subject to censorship appropriately.

%y%l%4*  %xThey must be executed in a location which also has its %y%lCOMBAT%x flag set.

%r%l%4*  %xThe location must not have its %y%l%(HAVEN%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<haven flag%>%x'.)

This flag can only be set/reset by %y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above.

When set on an administrator, this flag indicates that they have retired from their administative duties.  Both %r%lRetired Wizards%x and %rRetired Druids%x have the same privileges as an %r%lExperienced Builder%x (See '%g%l%<experienced builder%>%x') (The rules for %r%lExperienced Builders%x (See '%g%l%<experienced builder rules%>%x') apply to them.)

A retired administrator may also request to have their %y%lHELP%x flag set (See '%g%l%<help flag%>%x'), which entitles them to giving help and assistance to users (If this is set, the rules for %rAssistants%x (See '%g%l%<assistant rules%>%x') also apply to them.)

%PAGE
Retired administrators have no administrative privileges and cannot use commands or access information restricted to administrators only.

Retired administrators will usually be administrators who have been around for a long time, who can no-longer connect (Usually due to lack of time, IRL commitments or lack of access to the Internet) or connect for a sufficient amount of time to participate in general administrative duties.

This flag can only be set/reset on objects.

By default, an object which has an expiry time set (Using the '%g%l%(@expiry%)%x' command  -  See '%g%l%<@expiry%>%x') will expire and be automatically destroyed when its last usage date exceeds its expiry time (In days.)  This means that if the object is used regularly, it will not expire.

If the %y%lEXPIRY%x flag is set on the object, the expiry time will be based on its creation date instead.  This means that the object will expire after the specified amount of time, regardless of whether its being used or not.

This flag may only be set on %r%lExperienced Builders%x and %r%lRetired Wizards/%rDruids%x by %c%lWizards/%cDruids%x and above.

The %r%lExperienced Builder%x flag (See '%g%l%<experienced flag%>%x') is given to users with expert building and coding skills.  It gives them a number of new privileges to further improve and advance their building, and lifts some of the restrictions which apply to ordinary Builders for security.

%r%lExperienced Builders%x are not required to help or give assistance to new users.  This is a requirement of %rAssistants%x (And administrators, of course), who are given the status solely for that purpose.

%PAGE
However, if an %r%lExperienced Builder%x does wish to give help and assistance, they may ask an administrator to set their %y%lHELP%x flag, which will give them the right to use the '%g%l%(welcome%)%x' and '%g%l%(assist%)%x' commands (See '%g%l%<welcome%>%x' and '%g%l%<assist%>%x') in a similar way to %rAssistants%x when too few (Or no) administrators are connected.  It also allows them to see when new users are being created and informs them of users who need welcoming/assistance.

When an %r%lExperienced Builder%x has their %y%lHELP%x flag set, the rules which apply to %r%lAssistants%x (See '%g%l%<assistant rules%>%x') also apply to them (As well as the %r%lExperienced Builder%x rules (See '%g%l%<experienced rules%>%x'.))  If you no-longer wish to give help and assistance, please ask an administrator to reset your %y%lHELP%x flag.

%PAGE
If an %r%lExperienced Builder%x abuses privileges obtained through the %y%lHELP%x flag, but not those of the %r%lExperienced Builder%x flag, their %y%lHELP%x flag can be reset, leaving them with their %r%lExperienced Builder%x privileges, to which they are still entitled.

The %y%lHELP%x flag %c%lcannot%x be set or reset on %rAssistants%x.  It is a requirement of the %rAssistant%x status to give help and assistance to new users.  If you do not wish to do this, please ask an administrator to reset your %y%lASSISTANT%x flag.

The %y%lHELP%x flag also be set on retired administrators, giving them the ability to give users help and assistance.  If a retired administrator has their %y%lHELP%x flag set, the rules which apply to %rAssistants%x also apply to them.

For things (With the exception of vehicles), you can use '%g%l%(@lock%) <OBJECT> = me%x' as an alternative to %y%lIMMOVABLE%x, which will have the same effect, except that you can set appropriate %c%lfailure%x ('%g%l%(@fail%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@fail%>%x') and %c%lothers failure%x ('%g%l%(@ofail%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@ofail%>%x') messages, which will be displayed when a user (Other than yourself) tries to pick up the thing.

The drop-to (Set using '%g%l%(@link%)%x') of a room with its %y%lSTICKY%x flag set will be delayed until the last connected character leaves the room.  When the last connected character leaves the room, all objects dropped there (Except objects which have their home set to the room and their %y%lSTICKY%x flag set) will be sent to the drop-to location.

If an %y%l%(OPENABLE%)%x (See '%g%l%<openable flag%>%x') exit has its %y%l%(STICKY%)%x flag set, the exit will automatically close after a character goes through it.  If the lock of the exit is set, the exit will also automatically lock.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@set me|<COMMAND>|*<NAME> = TRACING
        @set me|<COMMAND>|*<NAME> = !TRACING%]%x

When you set yourself %y%lTRACING%x ('%g%l%(@set%) me = tracing%x'), a trace sequence is displayed whenever any of your compound commands are executed (Either by yourself or another character.)

Setting yourself %y%lTRACING%x will usually result in a lot of output (Especially if other characters are executing your compound commands.)  As an alternative, you can set %c%lINDIVIDUAL%x compound commands %y%lTRACING%x ('%g%l%(@set%) <COMMAND> = tracing%x'), so you only see a trace sequence when those compound commands are executed.

For each line executed by a compound command, you'll see the following trace sequence...

%[%c[%y%l%unnn%c]  %g%l<COMMAND>  %m%l(%uEXEC%m%l)
%c(%w%l%unnn%c)  %y%l<COMMAND>  %g%l(%uSUCC%g%l)%c/%r%l(%uFAIL%r%l)%]

%PAGE
The numbers in brackets ('%c[%y%l%unnn%c]%x' and '%c(%w%l%unnn%c)%x') tell you which line number of the compound command is currently being executed.  The '%c[%y%l%unnn%c]  %g%l<COMMAND>  %m%l(%uEXEC%m%l)%x' line shows you the complete command line before the '%y%l{}%x's in it are evaluated and expanded.

The following '%c(%w%l%unnn%c)  %y%l<COMMAND>  %g%l(%uSUCC%g%l)%c/%r%l(%uFAIL%r%l)%x' lines show the result(s) of evaluating and expanding the commands in '%y%l{}%x's (If present), followed by the final result of executing the fully expanded line.  '%g%l(%uSUCC%g%l)%x' means that the command succeeded, and '%r%l(%uFAIL%r%l)%x' means it failed.

%8%c%lHINT:  %xYou can turn the trace sequence on and off at will from within a compound command by simply inserting the commands '%g%l%(@set%) {%(@?myself%)} = tracing%x' and '%g%l%(@set%) {%(@?myself%)} = !tracing%x' to switch tracing on/off respectively.  Using this method, you can cut the output from the trace sequence down significantly.

%8%c%lNOTE:  %xIf you are building under the ID of another character ('%g%l%(@chuid%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@chuid%>%x'), you will also receive trace sequences for any of their compound commands which are set %y%lTRACING%x.

%TITLE Help on %w%ltransport%x (Vehicles)...
A vehicle is a thing which has its %y%l%(TRANSPORT%)%x flag set (See '%g%l%<transport flag%>%x'.)  Once this flag is set, the object becomes a vehicle and can no-longer be picked up, dropped, etc. (As with ordinary things.)

If the thing is a container, it becomes a vehicle which can be entered (I.e:  A %c%lcar%x, %c%llorry%x (%c%lTruck%x), etc.) and then driven through exits in its current location (Using the '%g%l%(drive%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<drive%>%x'), e.g:  '%g%l%(drive%) south%x'.)  You can also look at the vehicle's present location by typing '%g%l%(look%) outside%x'.

If the thing is not a container, it becomes a vehicle which can be ridden (I.e:  A %c%lmotorcycle%x, %c%lhorse%x, etc.) through exits in its current location (Using the '%g%l%(ride%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<ride%>%x'), e.g:  '%g%l%(ride%) horse = south%x'.)

%PAGE
The %y%l%(TRANSPORT%)%x flag also determines where vehicles can be driven/ridden.  When driving/riding a vehicle using the '%g%l%(drive%)%x' and '%g%l%(ride%)%x' commands, you must specify a destination, which can either be an %c%lexit name%x (In the vehicle's current location) or a %c%lroom #<ID>%x (I.e:  %y%l%(ABODE%)%x room  -  See '%g%l%<abode flag%>%x'.)

In order to use any of the above destinations (%c%lExit%x or %c%lroom%x), they must have their %y%l%(TRANSPORT%)%x flag set.  In addition to this, the destination room must also have its %y%l%(TRANSPORT%)%x flag set.

%PAGE
To drive/ride a vehicle, the character attempting to drive/ride it must be able to satisfy its lock (I.e:  If you lock the vehicle to yourself ('%g%l%(@lock%) <VEHICLE> = me%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@lock%>%x'), only you will be able to drive/ride it.)

If the vehicle's lock isn't satisfied, the %c%lfail message%x ('%g%l%(@fail%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@fail%>%x') is displayed to the driver/rider, and the %c%lothers failure message%x ('%g%l%(@ofail%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@ofail%>%x') is displayed to everyone in the vehicle's location.  If the vehicle is a container (Which must be entered before it can be driven), the %c%lothers failure message%x is also displayed to everyone inside the vehicle itself (Except the driver.)

%PAGE
On driving/riding the vehicle, its %c%lsuccess message%x ('%g%l%(@succ%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@succ%>%x') is displayed to the driver/rider, and the %c%lothers success message%x ('%g%l%(@osucc%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@osucc%>%x') is displayed to everyone in the vehicle's location.  If the vehicle is a container, the %c%lothers success message%x is also displayed to everyone inside the vehicle itself (Except the driver.)

On successfully reaching the destination location, its %c%ldrop message%x ('%g%l%(@drop%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@drop%>%x') is displayed to the driver/rider, and the %c%lothers drop message%x ('%g%l%(@odrop%)%x'  -  See '%g%l%<@odrop%>%x') is displayed to everyone in the destination location.  If the vehicle is a container, the %c%lothers drop message%x is also displayed to everyone inside the vehicle itself (Except the driver.)

If a thing has its %y%lTRANSPORT%x flag set, it becomes a mode of transport (E.g:  %c%lCar%x, %c%lmotorcycle%x, %c%lhorse%x, etc.)  This vehicle can then be 'driven' using the '%g%l%(drive%)%x' or '%g%l%(ride%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<drive%>%x' and '%g%l%<ride%>%x'.)

If a room has its %y%lTRANSPORT%x flag reset, vehicles will not be allowed in that room (I.e:  A street would have its %y%lTRANSPORT%x flag set, but a bedroom, kitchen, swimming pool, etc. would not.)

If an exit has its %y%lTRANSPORT%x flag reset, then vehicles will not be able to go through it (I.e:  A road leading north would have its %y%lTRANSPORT%x flag set, but a footpath would not.)

'%g%l@temp%x' sets the description of temporary variable %y%l<NAME>%x (If a temporary variable with the name specified doesn't exist, one is created.)  Temporary variables can be destroyed using the '%g%l@desttemp%x' command.

Temporary variables can only be created from within compound commands.  Their primary use is for temporary storage, use as counters, etc.

Once created, a temporary variable is accessible throughout the rest of the compound command it was created within and all compound commands called from that compound command (Via csuccess/cfailure, '%g%l%(@if%)%x', '%g%l%(@case%)%x', '%g%l%(@for%)%x', '%g%l%(@with%)%x', '%g%l%(@while%)%x', etc.), with the exception of compound commands owned by another character.

You can reference a temporary variable using %y%l$<NAME>%x, e.g:  If you have created a temporary variable called '%y%lstore%x' (E.g:  '%g%l@temp store = <DESCRIPTION>%x'), you can echo its current description using '%g%l%(@echo%) $store%x'.

%PAGE
All temporary variables created within compound command(s) are destroyed automatically when all of the commands have finished executing.  However, Mortals are restricted to a maximum of %c%l100%x temporary variables defined simultaneously, so you should destroy any temporary variables which are no-longer needed throughout the rest of the compound command(s).

        @undestroy #<ID> [#<ID>] [...] [= <NEW OWNER>]%]%x

The '%g%l@undestroy%x' command allows you to recover objects which have recently been destroyed (I.e:  If you accidentally destroy the wrong object by typing its ID number incorrectly, or destroy an object and then decide otherwise.)


%c%l%$Listing destroyed objects...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@undestroy list [<PAGE NO>] [<NAME>] [= <OBJECT TYPES>] [= <OWNER>]%]%x

The first form allows you to list objects on the queue of destroyed objects.  This allows you to browse through the list and see which objects you may recover, along with the original ID number of each object, which you will need in order to recover any destroyed objects.

%PAGE
If %y%l<PAGE NO>%x is specified, that page of destroyed objects will be displayed, e.g:  '%g%l@undestroy list 1%x', '%g%l@undestroy list 2%x', etc.

If %y%l<NAME>%x is specified, destroyed objects which contain the text %y%l<NAME>%x in their name will only be listed, e.g:  '%g%l@undestroy list bedroom%x'.

%y%l<OBJECT TYPES>%x is the types of objects to list (By default, all object types are listed, e.g:  '%g%l@undestroy list = things rooms%x' will list destroyed %c%l%(things%)%x and %c%l%(rooms%)%x only, '%g%l@undestroy list = properties%x' will list destroyed %c%l%(properties%)%x only, etc.

If %y%l<OWNER>%x is specified, destroyed objects which were originally owned by the character %y%l<OWNER>%x will only be listed, providing you are an %r%lExperienced Builder%x or above.

%PAGE

%c%l%$Recovering destroyed objects...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l@undestroy #<ID> [#<ID>] [...] [= <NEW OWNER>]%]%x

The second form allows you to recover a destroyed object (Or several destroyed objects, if more than one ID number is specified.)

When an object is recovered from the queue of destroyed objects, '%g%l@undestroy%x' will attempt to restore the original fields of the object, along with %c%lCSUCC/CFAIL%x links, %c%lhome%x, %c%ldestination%x, %c%lparent%x, %c%llock%x, etc.  Any destroyed objects which are still in the queue of destroyed objects and were originally located in or attached to the recovered object will also be recovered, and re-attached to the recovered object.  If the object's original ID number is still available, it will be allocated that ID number again, otherwise a new (Unused) ID number will be allocated to it.

%PAGE
To recover an object, its original ID number must be specified (If you are unusure what its original ID number was, you can use '%g%l@undestroy list%x' to find out), e.g:  You destroyed object '%y%lMy Bedroom(#12345 RHy)%x'  -  To recover this object, you'd type '%g%l@undestroy #12345%x'.

If %y%l<NEW OWNER>%x is specified, the owner of the recovered object(s) will be changed to the character %y%l<NEW OWNER>%x, providing you have '%c%lwrite%x' permission to them, and they have sufficient Building Quota.

%PAGE
%9%6%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xDestroyed objects are placed on a queue, which is of a finite size (Presently %y%l100%x objects may be on the queue at any one time.)  If the queue is full, then the oldest objects on it are permanently destroyed to make room for newly destroyed objects.  If you accidentally destroy an object, please try to recover it as soon as possible, otherwise it may drop off the end of the queue and be lost (Destroyed) permanently.

              %9%6You must have sufficient Building Quota to recover a destroyed object.  If you do not have sufficient Building Quota, the object and/or objects which were originally attached to it may not be recovered.

Unlinking a room removes its drop-to, if set (The location objects go to if dropped in that room.)

Unlinking an exit makes the exit lead nowhere, so you can re-link it (Using '%g%l%(@link%)%x') to another location.

Creates a variable called %y%l<NAME>%x attached to yourself (Building Quota used:  %c%l5%x.)  If %y%l<INITIAL SETTING>%x is specified, the description of the variable is set to that.

Unlike properties which only have a description, variables have all %c%l8 standard fields%x (Description, success, failure, drop, etc.)  Because of this, variables use more Building Quota than properties  -  You should only use variables if you can use most of their fields for useful storage  -  Use a property instead if you only need to use one field.

You can attach a variable to almost any other object (As long as you own/control it) by using '%g%l%(drop%)%x' or '%g%l%(@tel%)%x'.  You can even drop variables within variables.

%PAGE
When a variable is on yourself, you can substitute it into any text you're typing by typing '%y%l$%x' followed by the name of the variable (E.g:  '$myvar' would substitute the description of the variable 'Myvar'.)

To reference variables attached to anything else other than yourself, you must use '%y%l#<ID>:<VARIABLE NAME>%x', e.g:  If I had a variable called '%y%lstore%x' attached to a thing called '%y%lCabinet%x' with the ID %y%l#12345%x, I could reference that variable using '%y%l#12345:store%x', e.g:  To set the variable's description, I'd type '%g%l%(@desc%) #12345:store = <DESCRIPTION>%x'.

You can freely use the '%g%l%(@desc%)%x', '%g%l%(@succ%)%x', '%g%l%(@fail%)%x', '%g%l%(@drop%)%x', '%g%l%(@odesc%)%x', '%g%l%(@osucc%)%x', '%g%l%(@ofail%)%x' and '%g%l%(@odrop%)%x' messages (See help on each of these) of a variable.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%l!! [<PARAMETERS>]%]%x

%@%n has a last command recalling facility that works in a similar way to the '%y%lhistory%x' facility built into most UNIX systems.

%@%n always remembers the last command you typed (Until you disconnect.)

If you need to recall/re-execute the last command you typed, just simply type '%g%l!!%x' and press %c%lRETURN%x.  The last command you typed will then be executed.

You can also add text to the end of the last command you typed by typing '%g%l!!%x' followed by the text to add, e.g:  If you wanted to scan '%y%lJoe Bloggs%x' and then '%y%lFred Bloggs%x', you could type '%g%l%(scan%)%x' and press %c%lRETURN%x (See '%g%l%<scan%>%x'.)  You could then type '%g%l!! fred%x' and '%g%l!! joe%x' to scan '%y%lFred Bloggs%x' and '%y%lJoe Bloggs%x'.

%[%g%l[index[|<FIELD TYPE>][|<FIELD TYPE>...][|absolute]: <WILDCARD>]%]%x

Indexing allows you to only process objects with fields (%y%lName%x, %y%ldescription%x, etc.) that match a given wildcard specification.  You can specify which fields to match against %y%l<WILDCARD>%x by separating them with '%y%l|%x's, e.g:  '%g%l@with [index|name|desc: *something*] contents here do ...%x' will only process items in the contents list of the room you're in which have the text '%y%lsomething%x' in their name or description (The '%y%l*%x's are wildcards  -  See '%g%l%<wildcards%>%x' for details on how to use wildcards.)  If you don't specify any fields, name is assumed.
  
%PAGE
When processing the elements of a dynamic array, you can use '%g%l%(desc%)%x' (Contents of elements) or '%g%l%(indexname%)%x' (Index names of elements) as %y%l<FIELD TYPE>%x's, e.g:  '%g%l@with [index|desc: *test*] elements myarray do...%x' will only process elements of '%y%lmyarray%x' which contain the text '%y%ltest%x'.


%c%l%$<OBJECT TYPE>%x
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~%x
This is the type of objects/list to process, and can be one of the following...

%y%lAlarms%x, %y%larrays%x, %y%lcharacters%x, %y%lcommands%x, %y%lconnected%x (Process list of connected characters), %y%lcontents%x (Process contents list of object), %y%lelements%x (Process elements of dynamic array), %y%lenemies%x, %y%lexits%x, %y%lfothers%x, %y%lfriends%x, %y%lfuses%x, %y%lindex%x (Process index names of the elements of dynamic array), %y%lplayers%x (Same as %y%lcharacters%x), %y%lproperties%x, %y%lpuppets%x, %y%lrooms%x, %y%lthings%x, %y%lvariables%x.

%cDruids%x are mainly social orientated, and should be approached with non-building related questions and problems, especially where abusive and offensive users are concerned.

Building and coding questions should be refered to %c%lWizard%x administrators (See '%g%l%<wizards%>%x'), unless it is a simple question or problem which can easily be answered or dealt with (I.e:  By pointing user to appropriate help page.)

The %yApprentice Druid%x status is for new trainee %cDruid%x administrators, to prepare them for duties as a full %cDruid%x.  A user must achieve %rAssistant%x status (See '%g%l%<assistant%>%x') first as a Mortal before they can be promoted to %yApprentice Druid%x status.  This is to ensure that all new %yApprentice Druids%x have the basic skills required for the rank.

%yApprentice Druid%x privileges are mainly read-only, to minimalise causing accidental damage while learning new skills and getting used to administration.  If an %yApprentice Druid%x has any questions or is unsure about how to handle a particular situation, they should ask an administrator of a higher level, preferably a %cDruid%x or %gElder Druid%x.

%cDruids%x and above have full '%c%lread%x' and '%c%lwrite%x' privileges to all users below their level.

%TITLE Help on %w%lpromotions%x
Every user on %@%n starts off at %(Mortal%) status.  However, sooner or later, you may wish to progress up through the %(ranks%) (See '%g%l%<ranks%>%x'), and possibly eventually into a position within the administration team (Subject to %c%lsuitability%x and %c%lavailability%x.)  Below are brief details on how to go about obtaining promotion to various statuses, and the basic requirements of each.

%c%l%9%4IMPORTANT:  %xPlease %r%l%f%uDO NOT%x repetively ask current administrators to promote you to the statuses listed below.  Doing so may %m%l%ureduce%x your chances of promotion.  We %c%lcannot%x promote everyone, as there are only a %y%llimited number of positions available%x (With the exception of the %(Builder%) status.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Promotion to Builder status...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xThe Builder status allows you to build your own rooms, areas and locations, which can be explored and enjoyed by yourself, friends and other users.  In order to obtain Builder status, you must first ensure that your %c%lprivate%x E-mail address is set (See '%g%l%<@email%>%x' for details), and is valid (If it's already set, and is invalid, please ask a member of Admin. to change it for you, i.e:  '%g%l%(page%) admin = can someone change my private E-mail address for me, please?%x')

Once your private E-mail address is set, simply ask a member of Admin. to make you a Builder, i.e:  '%g%l%(page%) admin = Can I be a Builder, please?%x'

Before considering applying for Builder status, please ensure you both read and fully understand the rules for Builders (See '%g%l%<builder rules%>%x'.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Promotion to Assistant status...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%rAssistant%x status is awarded to %c%lfriendly%x and %c%lhelpful%x users, who are prepared to spend time helping and assisting users, even though they are not Admin.  In order to obtain this status, you will need to ask a member of Admin. to put you up for a vote (All members of Admin. will vote on your suitability for this status, over a period of a week.)  Before doing this, you will first need to prepare a brief summary of your credentials, complete with references from people you have helped and assisted (Give this information to the member of Admin. you ask, so that they can put it into the votable message in the %y%lAdmin%x area of %y%l%@%n BBS%x (See '%g%l%<bbs%>%x'.))  When voting closes, you will be told the result, and promoted if the vote is in favour.

Before considering applying for %rAssistant%x status, please ensure you both read and fully understand the rules for %rAssistants%x (See '%g%l%<assistant rules%x'.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Promotion to Experienced Builder status...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%r%lExperienced Builder%x status is awarded to advanced Builders, with excellent building and compound command (See '%g%l%<@command%>%x') writing skills and knowledge.  In order to obtain this status, you will need to ask a member of Admin. to put you up for a vote (All members of Admin. will vote on your suitability for this status, over a period of a week.)  Before doing this, you will first need to prepare a brief summary of your knowledge/credentials, complete with examples (And %c%l#ID numbers%x) of your best building work to date (Give this information to the member of Admin. you ask, so that they can put it into the votable message in the %y%lAdmin%x area of %y%l%@%n BBS%x (See '%g%l%<bbs%>%x'.))  When voting closes, you will be told the result, and promoted if the vote is in favour.

Before considering applying for %r%lExperienced Builder%x status, please ensure you both read and fully understand the rules for %r%lExperienced Builders%x (See '%g%l%<experienced builder rules%>%x'.)

%PAGE

%c%l%$Promotion to Apprentice Wizard or Apprentice Druid status (Admin)...
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xTo be promoted to an %y%lApprentice Wizard%x you must first achieve promotion to %r%lExperienced Builder%x status.  Likewise, you must achieve promotion to %rAssistant%x status before you can be promoted to %yApprentice Druid%x status.

Every few months, an %c%lAdmin Review%x takes place, where the status of current administrators is reviewed, and new administrators are promoted (If new Admin. are required and sufficient positions are available.)

If new administrators are required, current administrators will vote on suitable %r%lExperienced Builder%x and %rAssistant%x candidates.  Those with votes with %y%l60% majority%x in favour of promotion will be promoted.

%PAGE
The following credentials of each suitable candidate are considered by administrators voting in the Admin Review (In no particular order of importance):

   %4%y%lResponsibility%x, %y%lknowledge%x, %y%lexperience%x, %y%lfairness%x, %y%lmaturity%x, %y%lbuilding skill%x (%y%lApprentice Wizard%x), %y%linterpersonal skills%x, %y%lintegrity%x, %y%ltrustworthiness%x and %y%lstability%x.

Before considering applying for either %y%lApprentice Wizard%x or %yApprentice Druid%x status, please ensure you both read and fully understand the basic guidelines, rules and duties for administrators (See '%g%l%<admin rules%>%x' and '%g%l%<admin duties%>%x'.)

You can stop receiving messages from particular friends over the friends chatting channel by removing their %y%lFCHAT%x friend flag  -  See '%g%l%<fset%>%x' for details on how to do this.

Typing '%g%lfchat off%x' turns the friends chatting channel facility off (So you no-longer get disturbed by messages being sent over it by friends, e.g:  When you want to do some building.)  Typing '%g%lfchat on%x' will turn it back on again.

Simply set this friend flag ('%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = exclude%x') and they will no-longer appear as a friend (Or enemy) in your friends list (%c%lNOTE:  %xThe effects and meaning of setting this friend flag are completely different to those of the %y%l%(^friend ENEMY%)%x friend flag (See '%g%l%<enemy friend flag%>%x'), which indicates that the user is an enemy of yours.)

%PAGE
Although the user will still appear on your friends list, they will not show up as a friend (Or enemy) of yours, and you will not receive %g%l%(page%)%xs/%g%l%(tell%)%xs they send to their friends (They will also not receive yours), regardless of the setting of the %y%l%(^friend PAGETELLFRIENDS%)%x friend flag (See '%g%l%<pagetellfriends friend flag%>%x'.)

If you have set your %y%l%(FRIENDS-INFORM%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<friends-inform flag%>%x'), so that you are informed when users add/remove you from their list, or set/reset friend flags on you, you will not be informed if you have set the %y%lEXCLUDE%x friend flag on them in your friends list.

In addition to the above, if another user makes you a friend (Or enemy) of theirs against your wishes (I.e:  You are not their friend, or their enemy), and have set/reset friend flags on you so that you can't forcefully remove yourself from their list (Or they keep adding you again when you do so), you can add them to your list ('%g%l%(fadd%) <NAME>%x' (See '%g%l%<fadd%>%x')) and then set the %y%lEXCLUDE%x friend flag on them to make them no-longer appear as a friend (Or enemy) to you.

%TITLE Help on %w%lwildcards%x
Wildcards may be used with '%g%l%(@find%)%x', '%g%l%(@with%)%x', '%g%l%(@site list%)%x' and '%g%l%(@reload%)%x', as well as any compound commands which make use of the '%g%l{%(@?wildcard%)}%x' query.  They allow you to be more specific about what you'd like found, e.g:  '%g%l%(@find%) computer%x' will only find objects with the %c%lEXACT%x name '%y%lcomputer%x', whereas '%g%l%(@find%) *computer*%x' will find all objects with the string '%y%lcomputer%x' in their name.  There are two wildcard characters used in %@%n  -  These are '%y%l*%x' and '%y%l?%x'...

The '%y%l*%x' wildcard represents %c%lANY%x text at that point, providing the text to the left and/or right of the '%y%l*%x' is matched, e.g:  '%y%l*%x' on it's own will match %c%lANY%x text, '%y%l*the*%x' will only match text which has the letters '%y%lthe%x' in it (In that order), '%y%lan*%x' will only match text which %c%lBEGINS%x with the letters '%y%lan%x' and '%y%l*er%x' will only match text which %c%lENDS%x with the letters '%y%ler%x'.

%PAGE
You can use more than one '%y%l*%x' in a wildcard specification if you like, e.g:  '%y%l*the*and*%x' will only match text which has the letters '%y%lthe%x' in it %c%lFOLLOWED%x by the letters '%y%land%x'.

The '%y%l?%x' wildcard represents %c%lANY%x single character at that point, e.g:  '%y%lroom?%x' will match with '%y%lroom1%x', '%y%lroom6%x', '%y%lrooma%x', '%y%lroomf%x', etc.  %c%lPLEASE NOTE:%x  '%y%l?%x' %c%lCANNOT%x represent a blank character, e.g:  '%y%lroom?%x' %c%lWILL NOT%x match with '%y%lroom%x'.

If no wildcards are used, only text which %c%lEXACTLY%x matches the wildcard specification will be matched, e.g:  '%y%lthis%x' will %c%lONLY%x match to the %c%lEXACT%x text '%y%lthis%x'.

Bug reports are logged to the '%y%lBugs%x' log file.

'%g%lcomment%x' is used to make comments about %@%m, its administrators, builders and users (I.e:  Those who should perhaps be promoted in the near future), and anything else related which the administrators may wish to know about.  Comments are logged to the '%y%lComments%x' log file.

%PAGE
'%g%lcomplain%x' is used to make complaints of any nature, so that Admin. can deal with and resolve them as quickly as possible.  I.e:  If you are being harassed, abused or offended by another user, please use '%g%lcomplain%x' to complain to Admin. so that they can be stopped.  Complaints are logged to the '%y%lComplaints%x' log file.

'%g%lsuggest%x' is used to make a suggestion for improvement to %@%m and its database.  Such suggestions can include improvements to %@%m itself and its 'hard' code, 'soft' coded compound commands and areas on %@%m, on-line help pages and tutorials, etc.  Suggestions are logged to the '%y%lSuggestions%x' log file.

Typing '%g%lhome%x' on its own with no parameters will send you back to your home location.

Typing '%g%l%(homeroom%)%x', '%g%lhome room%x' or '%g%lhome%x' (If your home room is your current home, or '%g%lhome%x' twice if not) will take you to your home room (Every character is given a home room when they are first created  -  See '%g%l%<@homeroom%>%x'.)

Typing '%g%lhome home%x' or '%g%lhome homeroom%x' will set your home location to your home room, so typing '%g%lhome%x' will always take you there.

You can set your home to any room which either belongs to you or has its %y%l%(ABODE%)%x flag (See '%g%l%<abode flag%>%x') set (I.e:  You can see it's #ID number when you type '%g%l%(look%)%x' while in the room.)

%PAGE
To set your home, simply type '%g%lhome here%x' while you are in the room you wish to make your home.  Alternatively, if you know the room's #ID number, simply type '%g%lhome <#ID>%x', where %y%l<#ID>%x is the #ID number of number, e.g:  '%g%lhome #12345%x'.

%c%l%8NOTE:  %xYou can also set your home using the '%g%l%(@link%)%x' command (See '%g%l%<@link%>%x'), but the above method is far easier.

Some Telnet clients don't return the cursor to the far left of the screen when they receive a %y%lLF%x (%c%lLine Feed%x) character.  This results in a grossly messed up display.

In most cases, typing either '%g%lset lftocr lfcr%x' or '%g%lset lftocr crlf%x' fixes display problems.  The other options are '%g%lset lftocr cr%x' and '%g%lset lftocr lf%x' (Default.)  %y%lLF%x is a %c%lLine Feed%x character, and %y%lCR%x is a %c%lCarriage Return%x.

When 'more' paging is on ('%g%l%(set%) more on%x'), certain commands which usually produce a lot of output are automatically paged, allowing you to read the output without it scrolling past continuously.  These commands include:  '%g%l%(look%)%x', '%g%l%(scan%)%x', '%g%l%(inventory%)%x', '%g%l%(examine%)%x', the BBS '%g%lread%x' command (See '%g%l%<BBS%>%x'), the mail '%g%lread%x' command (See '%g%l%<mail%>%x'), '%g%l%(@list%)%x', '%g%l%(@find%)%x' and '%g%l%(@entrances%)%x'.

However, some Telnet clients have a 'more' paging or scroll-back facility built into them ('%g%l/more on%x' in %c%lTinyFugue%x for example), in which case you may like to disable 'more' paging in %@%m, by typing '%g%l%(set%) more off%x'.

%@%n Mail System is an easy to use internal mailing system that can be used to mail messages to other characters/friends (Regardless of whether they're connected or not.)  Using it is simple...

To mail a message to someone, simply type '%g%lmail <NAME>%x'.  Type your message, pressing %c%lRETURN%x after each line.  Once you've finished, type '%g%l%(.view%)%x' to check it and then '%g%l%(.save%)%x' to save your changes and mail your message (If you're happy with it.)  Otherwise, type '%g%l%(.abort%) = yes%x' to abandon your message (And not mail it.)

To list the latest messages in your mailbox, type '%g%lmail%x'.  If you're really popular and have lots of mail, you can list your first page of messages by typing '%g%lmail page 1%x', the second by typing '%g%lmail page 2%x', and so on.

To read a message that someone's mailed to you, type '%g%lmail read = <NUMBER>%x'.

%PAGE
To see how much mail you have, and how much of it is unread at a glance, type '%g%lmail update%x'.

To delete an item of mail you no longer want, type '%g%lmail delete = <NUMBER>%x'.  You can delete all of your mail by typing '%g%lmail delete = all%x'.

If you need any help, '%g%l%(page%)%x' or mail an %y%lApprentice Wizard/%yDruid%x or above.

Using the '%g%l%(^bbs vote%) <NUMBER> majority%x' BBS command (See '%g%l%<bbs vote%>%x'), the votes of a message on the BBS can be made subject to the '%c%lmajority factor%x', which weights the votes on the message depending on the rank of each voter.  The 'majority factor' is a percentage in favour, which is worked out by dividing the total score of votes in each direction (%y%lFor%x, %y%lagainst%x and %y%labstain%x) and dividing them into the total score for every single vote cast on the message.


%c%l%$The vote weighting is as follows...

%TITLE Help on '%w%lmore%x'
%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%lmore [<COMMAND>]
        more on|off%]%x

%@%n features a 'more' paging facility, which can be used to page the subsequent output of any command, so you can read it a page at a time rather than it uselessly scrolling past continuously.

You can turn the 'more' paging facility on by typing '%g%lmore on%x' or '%g%l%(set%) more on%x' (See '%g%l%<set more%>%x'.)  This will automatically page the output of the following commands (Which usually produce a lot of output):  '%g%l%(look%)%x', '%g%l%(scan%)%x', '%g%l%(inventory%)%x', '%g%l%(examine%)%x', the BBS '%g%lread%x' command (See '%g%l%<BBS%>%x'), the mail '%g%lread%x' command (See '%g%l%<mail%>%x'), '%g%l%(@list%)%x', '%g%l%(@find%)%x', '%g%l%(@entrances%)%x' and the various user lists (I.e:  '%g%l%(who%)%x', '%g%l%(swho%)%x', etc.)

However, some Telnet clients have a 'more' paging or scroll-back facility built into them ('%g%l/more on%x' in %c%lTinyFugue%x for example), in which case you may like to disable 'more' paging in %@%m, by typing '%g%lmore off%x' or '%g%l%(set%) more off%x'.

%PAGE
Regardless of whether the 'more' paging facility is on or off, you can force the subsequent output of %c%lANY%x command to be paged by typing '%g%lmore <COMMAND>%x', e.g:  '%g%lmore %(@list%) me = all%x'.

When the output of a command is paged with %@%m's 'more' paging facility, you'll see a line which looks something like the following:

%c[%c%l%uMORE%c:  %y%l(Page 1 of 3)  %c-  %c%l(%w%l%uN%c%l)ext/(%w%l%uP%c%l)revious page, (%w%l%uR%c%l)e-display or (%w%l%uS%c%l)kip...%c]%x

This shows you which page you are currently looking at, and how many pages there are in total.  You can display the next page by pressing the %c%lRETURN%x/%c%lENTER%x key on your computer/terminal, or by typing '%g%ln%x' ('%g%lnext%x'.)

%PAGE
You can re-display the current page by typing '%g%lr%x' ('%g%lredisplay%x'), go back to the previous page by typing '%g%lp%x' ('%g%lprevious%x'.)  You can also go to the first page by typing '%g%lf%x' ('%g%lfirst%x') and last page by typing '%g%ll%x' ('%g%llast%x'.)

You can skip the rest of the pages and leave the 'more' paging facility by typing '%g%ls%x' ('%g%lskip%x'.)  You can also execute any %@%m command whilst in the 'more' paging facility by typing '%g%l.<COMMAND>%x' or '%g%l.x <COMMAND>%x', e.g:  '%g%l.%(page%) fred = hello%x' (%c%lPLEASE NOTE:  %xThe output of any commands executed from within the 'more' paging facility %c%lWILL NOT%x be paged.)

%8%c%lHINT:  %xYou can make a compound command that automatically pages its output (Depending on the 'more' paging preference of the character executing it) by placing the command '%g%lmore%x' (Without any parameters) at the beginning of the compound command.

%[%c%lUSAGE:  %g%lpage <NAME>[,<NAME>][,<NAME>][...] [=] <MESSAGE>%]%x

This command is used to page a message to any character who's connected or a group of connected characters, regardless of whether they're in the same room as you.

If no message is given, the recipient(s) will be told that you're trying to contact them.

Characters who aren't connected, set %y%l%(HAVEN%)%x (See '%g%l%<haven flag%>%x') or have reset your %y%lPAGETELL%x friend flag (See '%g%l%<fset%>%x') will not receive your page.

You can page more than one person at once by giving a list of names separated by either '%y%l,%x' or '%y%l;%x', e.g:  '%g%lpage fred;joe = hello%x' will page the message "%y%lHello%x" to the users %c%lFred%x and %c%lJoe%x.  If you use '%g%lpage%x' without an '%y%l=%x' to separate the name(s) and message, the list of names must contain %c%lNO%x spaces.

%PAGE
You can send a group page to all your connected friends or enemies by typing '%g%lpage %(friends%) = <MESSAGE>%x' or '%g%lpage enemies = <MESSAGE>%x' and page all connected Admin (%y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above) by typing '%g%lpage admin = <MESSAGE>%x'.  You can also use '%g%l%(pf%) <MESSAGE>%x' to send a group page to all your connected friends.

When paging someone, only the first unique characters of their name are needed (E.g:  To page '%g%lFred Bloggs%x', you can type '%g%lpage fred = <MESSAGE>%x'.)

This command is used to tell a message to any character who's connected, or a group of connected characters, regardless of whether they're in the same room as you.

If all of the characters are in the same room as you, everyone else will hear what you say to them (Making '%g%ltell%x' a great way of directing messages to particular characters when having a big conversation in a room.)  If one or more recipients aren't in the same room as you, only the recipients will receive your message.

Characters who aren't connected, set %y%l%(HAVEN%)%x (See '%g%l%<haven flag%>%x') or have reset your %y%lPAGETELL%x friend flag (See '%g%l%<fset%>%x') will only receive your message if they're in the same room as you.

%PAGE
You can tell a message to more than one person at once by giving a list of names separated by '%y%l,%x' or '%y%l;%x', e.g:  '%g%ltell fred;joe = hello%x' will tell the users %c%lFred%x and %c%lJoe%x "%y%lHello%x".  If you use '%g%ltell%x' without an '%y%l=%x' to separate the name(s) and message, the list of names must contain %c%lNO%x spaces.

When telling a message to someone, only the first unique characters of their name are needed (E.g:  To tell '%y%lFred Bloggs%x' something, you can type '%g%ltell fred = <MESSAGE>%x'.)

You can tell all your connected friends or enemies a message by typing '%g%ltell %(friends%) <MESSAGE>%x' or '%g%ltell enemies <MESSAGE>%x' and tell all connected Admin (%y%lApprentice Wizards/%yDruids%x and above) a message by typing '%g%ltell admin <MESSAGE>%x'.  You can also use '%g%l%(tf%) <MESSAGE>%x' to tell a message to all your connected friends.

The second and third forms (A '%g%l>%x' or '%g%l.%x' followed by your message) are easier to type, e.g:  '%g%l.fred hello%x' to tell %c%lFred%x "%y%lHello%x".

The '%g%lrecall%x' command allows you to recall the last 8 messages sent to you via '%g%l%(page%)%x' or '%g%l%(tell%)%x'.

Typing '%g%lrecall%x' on its own (Without any parameters) will recall the last message sent to you (Along with the time, date and who it was from.)

'%g%lrecall list%x' will list the names of the senders of the last 8 messages, along with the time and date.  You can see the actual message by typing '%g%lrecall <NUMBER>%x', where %y%l<NUMBER>%x is the number of the message, e.g:  '%g%lrecall 1%x'.

You can reply to the last message you received by typing '%g%l%(reply%) <MESSAGE>%x' (See '%g%l%<reply%>%x') or reply to the message %y%l<NUMBER>%x in the list by typing '%g%l%(page%) <NUMBER> <MESSAGE>%x' or '%g%l%(tell%) <NUMBER> <MESSAGE>%x'.

%c%l%$The '%w%l%$.use%c%l%$' compound command
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xIn order for an object to be used, it must have a compound command named '%c%l.use%x' attached to it.  To attach a '%c%l.use%x' compound command to an object, simply teleport it into the object, e.g:  '%g%l%(@tel%) .use = <OBJECT>%x' (See '%g%l%<@tel%>%x'.)

When the object is used (By typing '%g%luse <OBJECT>%x'), its '%c%l.use%x' compound command is executed.  If optional %y%l<PARAMETERS>%x have been specified by the user, these will be given as parameters to the compound command in the usual manner (I.e:  %y%l$1%x, %y%l$2%x, %y%l$3%x, etc.)

%8%c%lNOTE:  %xAny type of object which can have compound commands attached to it can be used using the '%g%luse%x' command, even compound commands.

       %8%xA compound command with multiple names can include '%c%l.use%x', e.g:  '%y%lattack;.use%x'.

%TITLE Help on %w%lAction Compound Commands%x
%@%m features a number of special action compound commands which are executed when certain actions are performed on an object (For example, picking it up, looking at it, dropping it, etc.)

Each of these compound commands is prefixed with a '%g%l.%x', usually followed by a name which is appropriate for the command it is related to (E.g:  '%g%l.look%x' and '%g%l.looked%x' for the '%g%l%(look%)%x' command.)

To use action compound commands, simply create them and attach them to the required object (Using '%g%l%(drop%)%x' or '%g%l%(@tel%)%x'.)

The functionality of some action compound commands can also be replicated with fuses (See '%g%l%<@fuse%>%x'), but action compound commands can save you time, effort and Quota to achieve the same effect.

%c%l%$Restrictions:
%~%c~~~~~~~~~~~~~
%xWhen action compound commands execute, they will run under the ID of their owner, unless the %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x flag is set (See '%g%l%<wizard flag%>%x') or the action compound command is owned by Admin.

The action compound command will also disallow writing to the character executing the compound command (For example, you can't change their description)  Again, the %y%l%(WIZARD%)%x flag or admin ownership removes this restriction.

These restrictions are for security and to prevent abuse of action compound commands. 

%c%l%8NOTE:%x  '%g%l.lookdesc%x' follows the rules for '%g%l%(.scan%)%x' and '%g%l%(.profile%)%x' when attached to a character (It executes under the ID of the character looked at.)  Also, '%g%l.lookdesc%x' is executed when a character is scanned (Ideal for creating customised descriptions.)
%PAGE
%c%l%8NOTE:  %xAction compound commands (And other compound commands starting with '%g%l.%x') cannot be directly executed from the command-line by typing their name.  However, they can be executed by #ID or directly by name from within another compound command.

%c%l%8HINT:  %xTo save Quota, try combining multiple action compound commands on the same object into one, by naming just one compound command with all the names you require, separated by '%g%l;%x', e.g:  '%g%l.look;.lookdesc;.looked%x'.  You can then use the '%g%l{%(@?cmdname%)%g%l}%x' query command (See '%g%l%<@?cmdname%>%x') to test which action compound command has been invoked.

%TITLE Help on the '%w%l.message%x' variable
The '%g%l.message%x' variable is used to set alternative messages when someone pages/tells a message to you when you are set %y%l%(HAVEN%)%x, not connected, idle or have reset their %y%lPAGETELL%x/%y%lMAIL%x/%y%lLINK%x friend flag(s).

To create a '%y%l.message%x' variable, simply type '%g%l%(@var%) .message%x'.  You can then set the messages as follows...

%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@succ%) .message = <TIME>%x       Sets the time you have to be idle for (In secs) before your idle message ('%g%l%(@osucc%)%x' of '%g%l.message%x') is displayed.

%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@osucc%) .message = <MESSAGE>%x   Displayed when someone tries to page/tell a message to you and you've been idle for the amount of time (Or longer) specified in the '%g%l%(@succ%)%x' of your '%g%l.message%x' (In secs.)

%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@fail%) .message = <MESSAGE>%x    Displayed when someone tries to page/tell a message to you and you're set %y%l%(HAVEN%)%x.

%PAGE
%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@ofail%) .message = <MESSAGE>%x   Displayed when someone tries to page/tell a message to you and you're not connected.

%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@drop%) .message = <MESSAGE>%x    Displayed when someone tries to page/tell a message to you and you've removed their %y%lPAGETELL%x friend flag (E.g:  '%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = !pagetell%x'.)

%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@odrop%) .message = <MESSAGE>%x   Displayed when someone tries to send mail to you and you've removed their %y%lMAIL%x friend flag (E.g:  '%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = !mail%x'.)

%9%9%9%4%g%l%(@desc%) .message = <MESSAGE>%x    Displayed when someone tries to '%g%l%(@link%)%x' or '%g%l%(@tel%)%x' themselves to one of your (%y%l%(ABODE%)%x) rooms and you've removed their %y%lLINK%x friend flag (E.g:  '%g%l%(fset%) <NAME> = !link%x'.)
