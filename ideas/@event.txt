@event add <LOCATION> = <NAME> = <TYPE> [<OPTIONS>] = <MATCH SPEC> = <COMMAND>

<LOCATION>

Location of event - Can be character, room, thing, exit (Blank defaults to 'me'.)

<NAME>

Short name for event, to refer to it when using '@event'.

<TYPE> = command|input|output|move|login

command = When given command is executed (Matched on first param of
                   command-line.  {@?cmdname} = command, $1 = 1st param,
                   $2 = 2nd param, $3 = all three.
input   =  User input matches <MATCH SPEC> - $1/$2/$3 = Input as per compound command.
output =  Screen output matches <MATCH SPEC> - $1/$3 = Output.
move = When user moves $1 = Source, $2 = Destination
login = When user connects/disconnects $1 = Connect | Disconnect.
test = <MATCH SPEC> is command that's performed each time user types command - if sucessful <COMMAND> is executed, i.e:  test = {@?set me = male} = @echo (M)
startup = Performed at TCZ start-up - <MATCH SPEC> is ignored.  Useful for setting defaults in areas, etc.  Exec limit is set to 2 secs as default.
hourly|daily|weekly|monthly - Performed by TCZ once per hour, day, week or month - queued at 5 sec intervals with exec limit set to 2 secs.  Again useful for setting defaults or running timed events without use of alarms. 

For hourly|daily|weekly|monthly,  <MATCH SPEC> is preferred time/day to run, in form HH:MM DD MT - DD = 1-31 (Day of month), MON-SUN (Day of week), LAST = Last day of month, MT = Month 1-12, JAN-DEC  -  * can be used in field to mean 'any'.

Example:  hourly = *:30   -  Run at half-past the hour.
12:00 TUE *  -  Run on Tuesday at midday.
16:01 THU DEC - Run at 16:01 on Thursdays in December.
23:00 LAST * - Run on last day of each month.

<OPTIONS> = pre|post|abort

pre = Execute before action
post = Execute after (A bit like sticky fuse)
abort = For pre, abort rest of command if matched (Only for admin, like abort fuses.) - Will also work on (W) set objects.  Use @continue to stop abort.

<MATCH SPEC>

Wildcard spec of what to match for - event executes if match.  Blank = no matching, always execute (Useful for 'move'/'login'.)  If no *'s are used, *<MATCH SPEC>* is assumed.   No matching is performed for 'move' and 'login' events.

<COMMAND>

Command to exec - Can either be #ID or a single command-line - executed with security model of execute_action_command() to prevent abuse (I.e: Under ID of event owner and no write access to user involking it.)

@event delete <LOCATION> = <NAME> [= yes]  -  Delete event - 'yes' req. if deleting someone else's event (Admin.)
@event list <LOCATION> = [<TYPE>] [<NAME>]  - List events.
@event enable|disable <LOCATION> = <NAME>  -  Disable or enable an event.

Special related query for use in '@event' commands:

{@?event name|type|options|spec|cmd}


@event details <LOCATION> = <NAME>

Show detailed information about event, including when it will next run.  Could also include info such as who last involked it and at what time.

User input event needs some sort of monitoring to stop 'spying'?

When events are queued, entry on user determines time next event they own will be ran - 10 secs between events for normal users, 5 secs for admin.

Cost of events = 1 quota per X events (To be determined.)
