-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
  -  MUD's based on The Chatting Zone (TCZ) have the following features...  -
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

*  The TCZ source code is publicly released under the GNU General Public
   License (GPL) and is available for download from:

      https://github.com/smcvey/tcz

*  Extensive, detailed built-in On-line Help System.
   (Type 'help' on a TCZ-based MUD :-)

*  Tutorials for new users (Teaches you the basics of TCZ-based MUD's (Talking,
   moving around, using the internal mail system, BBS (Bulletin Board System),
   etc.))  (Type 'tutorial' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Optional ANSI colour support for Telnet connections, along with a
   substitution system that allows you to easily use colour in speech,
   descriptions, etc.  The original TCZ-based MUD (The Chatting Zone)
   was one of the first social orientated multi-user environments to
   implement ANSI colour support.  (ANSI colour support was implemented
   in TCZ v2.2 (27/06/1994.))  (Type 'help ansi colour' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Clear and easy to read output (E.g:  Room descriptions, user lists, object
   details (When examined), etc.)  (Type 'look' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Built-in word-wrapping facility (Handles ANSI colour/terminal high-light
   codes and indents text correctly (For example in lists.))
   (Type 'help set wrap' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Chatting Channels (Which can optionally be made private.)
   (Type 'help chat' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Localised yelling system (Allows Builders to let Mortals yell messages
   across their area(s).)  (Type 'help yell' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Name prefixes and suffixes (Ask an administrator to set them for you.)
   (Type 'help @prefix' and 'help @suffix' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Powerful (But easy to use) line editor for editing descriptions, compound
   commands, etc.  The editor can be used to edit most object types in a
   TCZ-based MUD.  (Type 'help editor' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Informative and easy to read statistics commands ('@stats'), '@contents'
   command (Displays a summary of the contents of a object) and '@quota'
   command (Displays summary on what you've used your Building Quota on.)
   (Type 'help @stats', 'help @contents' and 'help @quota' on a TCZ-based
   MUD.)

*  User ranking facility ('@rank'.)  Ranks all users in the database by
   total connect time, longest connect time, last connect time, score,
   amount of credit, etc.  (See 'help @rank' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Grouping/range operators (Unique to TCZ-based MUD's)  -  A powerful
   feature that allows lists of items to be paged and restricted to a
   given range.)  (Type 'help group' and 'help range' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  String/list/sentence processing queries.
   (Type 'help advanced' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  '@if', '@case', '@while' and '@for' selection/iteration commands.
   (Type 'help @if', 'help @case', 'help @while' and 'help @for' on a
   TCZ-based MUD.)

*  '@break', '@breakloop', '@goto' and '@return' flow control commands.
   (Type 'help @break', 'help @breakloop', 'help @goto' and 'help @return'
   on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Powerful '@with' command with indexing feature which makes the processing of
   linked lists (Attached to objects), the list of connected characters and
   the elements of dynamic arrays a breeze.  (Type 'help @with' on a TCZ-based
   MUD.)

*  '@foreach' command for processing lists of items.
   (Type 'help @foreach' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Pronoun, ANSI colour, text attribute, text formatting and query
   command/calculation substitutions which can be used in most text (E.g:
   'say', 'emote', '@desc', '@succ', '@fail', '@drop', '@odesc', '@osucc',
   '@ofail', '@odrop', '@echo', '@oecho', '@oemote', etc.)
   (Type 'help substitutions' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Last command recalling facility.  (Type 'help !!' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Better Telnet protocol handling and terminal support (When not using ANSI
   colour, hi-lights will be used instead (If your terminal supports them.))
   (See 'help set' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  User definable aliases for commands.
   (See 'help @alias' and 'help aliases' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Personal friends/enemies lists, friend flags and friends chatting channel
   facility.  (See 'help friends' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Dynamic arrays with optional element indexing.
   (See 'help @array' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Ability to page/tell messages to a list of people rather than just a single
   person.  (See 'help page' and 'help tell' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Facility for recalling and replying to the last 8 pages/tells sent to you.
   (See 'help recall' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Inheritance  -  Standard fields (Description, success, failure, etc.),
   locks, aliases (Characters only) and object lists (Contents, exits,
   compound commands, etc.) of an object may be inherited from a parent object.
   (See 'help inheritance' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Building Quota system  -  Each character has a Building Quota that restricts
   the maximum amount of stuff they can have built at any one time (Of course,
   the character must be a Builder to build anything in the first place.)
   Building Quotas replace the old and obsolete Building Points system.
   (See 'help @quota' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Database of registered Internet sites, which Internet sites can be added to,
   modified, listed, modified, deleted, etc. on-line.  Flags can also be set
   on individual sites to implement bans, create bans, etc.
   (See 'help @site' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Easy to use, built-in topic-based Bulletin Board System (BBS.)
   (See 'help bbs' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Temporary variables  -  These may be created within compound commands for
   temporary storage, use as counters, etc.
   (See 'help @temp' and 'help @desttemp' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Two distinctive types of administrator  -  Wizard ranks (Building
   orientated), who should be your first choice for building help and advice,
   and Druid ranks (Non-building orientated), who are there to help out new
   users, non-building related questions/problems from existing users and to
   sort out problems between users and abusive users, etc.
   (See 'help druid' and 'help wizard' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Article support  -  Article specific flags may be set on objects to add
   the correct article ('a', 'an' or 'some') to the object automatically, and
   to all references to it (E.g:  'A chair', 'An oak chest', 'Some sweets'.)
                                   ~          ~~              ~~~~
   (See 'help articles' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  'Interactive' prompting via the '@prompt' command  -  Allows creation of
   menus, knowledge tests, etc. where the user can enter their choice/answer
   at a prompt, rather than having to type a command followed by their
   choice/answer.  (See 'help @prompt' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Users can tie the knot virtually and be 'net' married to each other.
   (See 'help @partner' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  System for handing out 'read', 'write', create and destroy permissions to
   other characters (Allowing them access to your objects) via friend flags.
   Both full and restricted access may be given, allowing other users to help
   you with your building projects and/or work on them with you, and large
   building projects to be worked on by groups of users.
   (See 'help fset' and 'help group building' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Ability to recover accidentally destroyed objects.
   (See 'help @undestroy' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Automatic maintenance of unused characters and objects in the database,
   helping keep the database free of redundant objects.  Redundant characters
   and objects are destroyed on a weekly basis.
   (See 'help expiry', 'help @expiry', 'help junked objects', 'help date
   stamps', 'help @admin' and 'help @maintenance' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  User creatable vehicles, which can be driven/riden around the world of the
   TCZ-based MUD (In locations which allow transport, such as streets, etc.)
   (See 'help transport' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  E-mail forwarding facility for users on the TCZ-based MUD.
   (See 'help @email' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  System and user log files, making administration easy by allowing
   administrators to browse categorised log files without requiring
   access to the server machine.  User log files allow Builders to
   see failed commands typed by users within their areas, as well as
   logging their own custom entries using '@logentry'.
   (See 'help @log' and 'help @logentry' on a TCZ-based MUD.)

*  Low maintenance  -  Automatic database consistency checking and maintenance
   (Such as deleting unused characters) makes life easier for the
   administrators of TCZ-based MUD's.

*  Zero Memory Database Dumping  -  Allows the TCZ-based MUD's database to be
   dumped to disk in the background without forking a separate process or
   using any extra memory on the server machine, preventing the TCZ-based MUD
   from 'lagging' when the database dumps.

*  Forked database dump for operating systems which properly support
   copy-on-write memory pages (Such as recent versions of Linux.)  This has
   the advantage of being quick (Taking only a few minutes to dump a large
   database) and subject to no inconsistencies.  This is recommended rather
   than the Zero Memory dump.  Falls back to the Zero Memory dump if the
   forked dump fails for any reason.

*  Command-line start-up options and configuration file support, allowing
   many parameters to be changed without needing to recompile the source
   code.
