 How it all began...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The Chatting Zone (TCZ) all began as a dream I had to write the 'ultimate'
 MUD/talker system.  In those days, I was only a user/builder on a
 number of MUD's around at the time.  My aim was to design and develop
 a system of my own, which was not only user-friendly and easy to use, but
 also extremely flexible and powerful too.

 On the 21st December, 1993 I downloaded the source to TinyMUD v1.5 and
 began to turn it into the bare basics of TCZ.  At this time, I was
 studying at the University of Greenwich in London, UK, and my Internet
 access was very limited (Home Internet access in the UK at that time was
 virtually non-existant.)

 The game was ran locally on one of the servers at the university, where it
 picked up its first ever regular users (Ratty, Diceman, The Captain and UK1
 -  Most of these users are still with us today.)

 After the Christmas 1993 holidays, I obtained an early version of the UglyMUG
 source code (1990-1991 version)  -  Both this and the TinyMUD code (Which I
 was still working on) were both very primitive and unstable.  Over the next
 few weeks, I intergrated the TinyMUD code and most of the features I had
 added to it into the UglyMUG code to produce the basics of TCZ v1.0 (10th
 March 1994.)


 TCZ goes 'live' at the University of Plymouth...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Two months of hard work and bug fixing saw the completion of TCZ v2.0 (18th
 May 1994)  -  This version was just about functional enough for networked
 use  -  All I had to do was find an Internet site from where I could test
 and run it.  After a few weeks of searching, I was offered the opportunity
 to run it on a machine at the University of Plymouth, where a student BBS
 system (Originally named 'Hades BBS', then later 'Flux BBS') was presently
 operating.

 I accepted the offer of a site and TCZ became available 'net-wide' for the
 first time ever near the end of May 1994 (zeus.sc.plym.ac.uk, port number
 8342.)  The main administrators of the game were me (JC Digita), Whoosh,
 Case and Nemo (Whoosh, Case and Nemo were the administrators of 'Flux BBS'.)

 At this time, the game was very unstable (An up-time of 1 day was extremely
 rare) and it had very few features.  Although we never had peaks of more than
 10-15 users at that time, running the game 'net-wide' enabled many bugs which
 had evaded testing sessions to be tracked down and fixed, resulting in
 greater stability.

 Plymouth TCZ saw the introduction of a simple town structure to the game.
 This was fairly successful, but wasn't planned or organised  -  I saw
 the potential for a good town layout for the basis of the game, so I drew up
 a map on paper (Which I still have today) and started to develop this town
 on my own copy of TCZ, which was still running locally at the University of
 Greenwich.

 Near the end of June 1994 saw the completion of TCZ v2.2  -  In this version,
 ANSI colour was implemented, the connection interface was improved (So you
 were prompted to enter your name, password, etc. instead of having to type
 'connect <NAME> <PASSWORD>' or 'create <NAME> <PASSWORD>'), character names
 with spaces were allowed (Thanks to the new connect interface) and early
 versions of the '@if', '@for', '@with' and '@while' (Selection and interation)
 commands were implemented.

 After a few weeks of enjoying TCZ v2.2 at Plymouth, it was the end of term,
 and the long (About 3 months or more) summer holidays began...


 The summer re-write...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Over the summer holidays I had no access to the Internet (I didn't have a
 modem at the time and there were no Internet Service Providers within 100
 miles of my home town either.)

 I decided that there was very little chance of the code in its present state
 ever running reliably, and its design wasn't flexible enough for the
 developments I had planned for TCZ in the future, so I spent most of my time
 over the summer holidays taking the entire game apart, re-designing and
 re-writing large portions of the code from scratch.

 Nearing the end of the summer holidays, the more stable and efficient basis
 for TCZ was nicely taking shape:  The entire database structure had been
 improved to allow flexibility for future expansion, the socket code (Which
 handles the Telnet connections of users) had been re-written from scratch
 and the command-line editor was implemented, along with an early version of
 the On-line Help System.

 Thanks to downloading and installing Linux 1.0.8 on my 386DX/40 computer
 before going home for the summer holidays, I was able to undertake the
 vast task of redesigning, re-writing and testing the code without any
 access to the Internet or the UNIX server machines at the university.

 Help pages were created from the Official Manual ('manual.txt') and the
 finishing touches were put to a number of the main locations in the town
 (Such as The Swan Pub, The Chatting Zone Luxury Flats and several shops.)

 Plymouth TCZ was scrapped over the summer holidays.


 Term begins again...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The summer holidays passed very quickly, and before I knew it, I was back in
 London again, living in student accommodation instead of halls of residence.
 With just a week to go before lectures started again, I decided to splash out
 and upgrade my computer.  Soon I was sitting at a 486DX/2 with 8 meg of RAM.

 Soon I was back on the Internet, and enjoying the upgrades made to the
 university's computer network over the holidays:  We now had full Internet
 access, including Telnet, FTP, etc.  I soon had TCZ installed, compiled and
 running again on one of the University's machines (atlas.gre.ac.uk, port
 number 8342.)  I introduced my two flat mates (Scavy and Demon) to TCZ,
 who very quickly became hooked to it.

 Thanks to the re-write over the summer holidays, the game was more stable
 and often stayed up for longer than a day without crashing.  Most of the
 original Plymouth TCZ users were soon connecting to TCZ again, and a number
 of them were recruited to form the new Admin team.  Crafty, Joliet Jake,
 NorthernGet and Unicorn were given Wizard status, along with many other
 users who were given Apprentice Wizard status.

 From this point onwards, I started planning and implementing the huge number
 of ideas and features (Many original and unique) which I had for TCZ and its
 code.

 TCZ very soon had peaks of 15-20 users, so it wasn't long before the staff
 at the University began to notice it.  One member of University staff began
 to explore the town and unfortunately wandered into an area built by a user
 which was slightly X rated.  24-hours later I was forced to shut the game
 down permanently at the University.


 The search for a new site...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Having lost our University of Greenwich site (Where TCZ ran for about 2-3
 weeks), the long, hard search for a new site began.  During the next month,
 I sent out E-mails to every Internet Service Provider and suitable site I came
 across.  After receiving many refusals, and being offered leased line rental
 at a cost of 300 UK pounds or more per month, an error occurred in my favour.

 An E-mailed reply, which was aimed at one of the many Internet Service
 Providers I had been trying for a site accidentally ended up at a company
 called Lasermoon Ltd., UK.  It turned out that they were having a 64Kb
 leased line installed soon and would be setting up an FTP server on it.

 As I was the first person who had asked, I was offered the opportunity to
 put a machine of my own on their network, from which I could run TCZ.  The
 leased line wouldn't be operational until late November, so I had several
 weeks to try and get a suitable server machine together.

 I still had the motherboard and case of my old 386DX/40, so this, along with
 the addition of 8 meg of RAM, a 450Mb hard disk and a network card became the
 basis of a server machine on which to run TCZ.

 After having the machine delivered to Lasermoon, I eagerly awaited for their
 leased line and the machine to go on-line.  Around 5pm on November 28th 1994,
 I connected to the machine for the first time (Named Reliant (After the
 Startrek starship, NOT the car :)

 Having successfully managed to log on to the machine, I uploaded TCZ's code
 and compiled it.  At around 6pm, users of TCZ when it was at the University
 of Greenwich got the news they'd been waiting to hear:  TCZ was back!!!


 The Chatting Zone at Lasermoon...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 One of the biggest problems with starting up The Chatting Zone from its new
 Lasermoon site was that we had to provide our own server machine on which to
 run the game.  Being a student, I had very little money to spare, but luckily
 I had recently upgraded my 386DX/40 to a 486DX/2 66mhz (I still had my
 386DX/40, which I originally planned to sell.)

 To begin with, the 386 was perfectly adequate (With 8 meg of RAM) to run TCZ
 (At this time there were only around 2,000 objects in the database.)  However,
 the 386 soon began to get overloaded and over worked (Especially when
 complicated compound commands were executed.)  It did manage to handle
 30 users though without getting too bogged down.

 A few months on, the 386 was no-longer adequate, and was beginning to run low
 on memory.  To solve the problem, I bought a 486DX/33 motherboard and an extra
 4 meg of RAM  -  This was installed in the machine, giving an instant
 improvement in speed and giving it 12 meg of RAM.

 Around early March 1995, we managed to establish a small overseas userbase,
 which began to increase at a rapid rate, on top of the already established
 UK userbase, which was also expanding at an equal rate.  It soon became
 apparent that the Building Point system needed redesigning and replacing
 with a more controlled system  -  Building Points were scrapped and replaced
 with Building Quotas, which allowed us to keep a much tighter control on the
 expansion rate of the database (At this time, the database was expanding
 faster than we could cope  -  One week we put in an extra 4 meg of RAM, the
 next week it was all used up.)

 At 5:26pm, 28th November 1995 (Only an hour before TCZ celebrated its first
 birthday of running at its Lasermoon site), a peak of 100 users was reached
 for the first time ever.


 The move to a new site...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 The site at Lasermoon was adequate for over a year, but fairly soon, problems
 started setting in.  The company needed to use the line to transfer large
 quantities of data as part of their day-to-day business, which very quickly
 started causing problems by using up a lot of bandwidth and in turn slowing
 connections to TCZ down to a crawl.  At first, this wasn't too much of a
 problem, as it only occurred during business hours.  However, fairly soon,
 it became a 24-hour problem, and as a result, TCZ and its reputation began
 to suffer (As long periods of excessive delay (Or 'lag') which were not the
 fault of TCZ itself spoilt the game for its users.)

 By this time, I had already established a good friendship with a local
 Internet Service Provider (AngliaNet Ltd.) in my home town of Ipswich,
 England.  In return for the help and assistance I gave them, I was offered
 the opportunity to move TCZ's server machine on-site.  This had many
 advantages, including ample bandwidth and the server machine itself being
 within a short distance of my home (To upgrade or resolve problems would
 only require a 10 minute journey instead of an expensive 200 mile journey
 to where Lasermoon were based.)

 Everything was set, and the move took place.  Some 5000+ E-mails were sent
 out to users of the game to inform them of its new address, and the major
 task of changing its address on the 100's of MUD lists on which it was
 registered began.  After a week, most regular users had found their way
 to the new location and the number of new users being created began to
 increase again.

 With the move, several other changes took place, including a hardware upgrade
 to the server machine and the moving of TCZ's FTP and World Wide Web sites to
 its server machine.  The domain 'galaxsw.co.uk' was registered for GALAX
 Software Ltd., giving the addresses 'tcz.galaxsw.co.uk' for TCZ,
 'www.galaxsw.co.uk' for its World Wide Web site and 'ftp.galaxsw.co.uk' for
 its FTP archive.  In addition to this, E-mail could now be sent to
 'tczadmin@galaxsw.co.uk'.


 Miscellaneous...
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 TCZ has exceeded all of my original expectations, and there's very little
 in my original dream of writing the 'ultimate' MUD which hasn't been
 achieved.  Even after so many years of development, TCZ still presents
 a steady stream of new programming challenges, along with the enjoyment
 of implementing them  -  I look forward to continuing the development
 of the TCZ source code for many years to come, along with help from
 others now that TCZ is public open source code released under the GNU
 General Public License (GPL.)

 *  When you couldn't have spaces in your name or name prefixes/suffixes?
 *  When you had to type 'connect <NAME> <PASSWORD>' to connect?
 *  When there was no ANSI colour support (In the very early Plymouth days)?
 *  When there was a code update almost every day to fix major bugs and
    implement new features?
 *  When an uptime of more than 1 day was extremely rare?
