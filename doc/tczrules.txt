                The Official TCZ Rules (As from 01/08/2001)...


Introduction...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The official rules are a detailed set of guidelines for ALL users and
administrators of The Chatting Zone, implemented and intended to maintain
order amongst both its users and administrators.

These rules help keep TCZ a friendly and enjoyable environment for all of its
users by helping keep it free from abusive and malicious people, and users who
misuse privileges with which they have been entrusted (This includes Builders
and administrators.)

As a user of TCZ, you are expected to thoroughly read, understand and abide by
these rules at all times.  If you fail to do so, and break rules intentionally
or unintentionally, you will receive appropriate punishment.  This will
initially be in the form of a verbal warning and possible removal of abused
privileges, but if you continue to ignore and break rules, you could be banned
from TCZ completely.

Each rule may be preceeded by a rating (E.g:  '<<<1>>>'.)  The number (On a
scale of 1 (Not too serious) to 5 (Very serious)) indicates how serious
breaking that particular rule will be treated.  The ratings are intended as a
guideline, and will be used to help decide on suitable punishment when a rule
is broken.

PLEASE NOTE:  If a rule has a low rating, this does not mean that it is
              acceptable to purposely break it or ignore the fact that it
              has been broken.  If a rule is broken, suitable punishment
              must be issued promptly.

              These rules apply to the date at the top of this file.  The
              administrators of TCZ reserve the right to change, ammend or
              add to these rules at any time without prior notice.  Any
              significant additions or ammendments will be announced on The
              Chatting Zone BBS in the NEWS topic (See 'help bbs' on TCZ.)

`-----------------------------------------------------------------------------'


Terms used in the Official Rules...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Admin   Administrators of The Chatting Zone (TCZ)  -  Any character who is an
        Apprentice Wizard/Druid or above.

MUD     Any multi-user game, adventure/role playing game, talker or Bulletin
        Board System (BBS) which can be accessed via the Internet.

TCZ     The Chatting Zone.


Safety Guidelines for ALL users of TCZ...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
All users of TCZ should be aware that things that occur in real life, either
if they are directly or indirectly linked to occurances on TCZ, that the
administrators cannot be held responsible, nor can they punish or ban users
without proof that abuse has actually occurred on TCZ.  We advise that all
users of TCZ, in common with all other forms of anonymous Internet
communication, should follow some basic safety guidelines:

*  NEVER give out your real life personal details (Home address, telephone
   number, etc) to anyone you do not know in real life  -  Even if you've
   known them 'virtually' for a long time, they may not be who you think they
   are.

*  NEVER forget that others may adopt 'Internet Personas' which may, or may
   not, correspond to their real life personas.  In other words, don't believe
   all you read!

*  REMEMBER, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.

If something is happening in real life as a result of the occurances of not
following the above guidelines, please note, we can only advise the following:

   Get in touch with the Police, or whatever other Authorities you can
   (Offender's Internet Provider(s), etc.) and pass on the information
   you know.  We can only act upon punishable offenses we see and have
   proof of on TCZ.

IMPORTANT:  The administrators of TCZ will *NOT* see fit to punish possible
            users who use *NON* TCZ related incidents in order to cause or
            inflict spite or punishment of other possible users.  To punish
            a user requires solid proof that the user did do something wrong,
            and that proof needs to be visible to other administrators on 
            TCZ's server.


Guidelines for Acceptable Behaviour...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Administrators of TCZ must take a conservative view towards certain
forms of language and behaviour in public locations such as the BBS and the
Swan Pub, regardless of their personal opinions about such things.

The CENSOR flag (See 'help censor flag') was incorporated into TCZ to protect
both younger users and TCZ itself from any complaints made to its host and/or
server administrators.

However, not all forms of slang/vulgarity are caught by the automatic bad
language censor which is active in public locations, and the following
guidelines are a companion to the auto-censor and guide for the user
for acceptable language and behaviour in the public areas of TCZ.


Public Rooms
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Public discussions of a sexual nature must use proper, clinical terminology,
in its correct context.  If you use vulgarities/slang at all in public areas
(This includes attempts to get around the auto-censor by using different
spellings or ASCII characters), you will be asked to stop or take it to a
private room or chat channel.

Failure to comply with the Administrator's request will result in an Official
Warning and/or further punishment.


The BBS (Bulletin Board System)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Due to the nature of some BBS topics, sexual discussions take place.  Their
purpose is to inform and help users with sexual problems or questions.
This does not give license to use improper, vulgar terminology in these
discussions.  You must use the proper, clinical terms in their correct context.

Any malicious BBS post done merely to provoke a slagging match, 'spam'
(Excessive posting), or to attack another user, will be censored or
removed depending on the content and the user will be warned to stop.

Any BBS post found to contain vulgar words and/or phrases (This also
includes attempts to get around the auto-censor by using different spellings
or ASCII characters) will be censored or removed by the Administrators, and
if necessary an Official Warning will be given.

Failure to comply with this may result in the loss of your BBS flag and an
entry on your rapsheet.


Final Words
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Admin have no wish to inhibit the users of TCZ.  Certain forms of
discussions are not being prohibited, we merely ask that if you are going to
be in a public location, such as The Swan Pub, you exercise caution when using
terminology that might be considered offensive.

What you do or say in private rooms is your business and no Admin will ever
interfere with that.  However, public areas such as the BBS or The Swan Pub
MUST BE KEPT CLEAN to protect younger users.


Rules for General Users...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  As a general (Mortal) user of The Chatting Zone, you are free to do and say
   whatever you like within reason, providing it is not prohibited by the rules
   or disclaimer of TCZ.

*  If any complaints are received from other users about you, they will be
   fully investigated and appropriate action will be taken if you refuse to
   stop (Depending on the severity, this could involve imposing a ban on your
   site and/or sending a complaint to your system Adminstrator(s) (Which could
   result in you losing your access to the Internet.))

*  <<<4>>>  You must not 'spam' (Send large quanities of output), abuse,
   harrass, offend or invade the privacy of other users.

*  <<<5>>>  The distribution/sharing of illegal or pornographic material
   is STRICTLY prohibited.

*  <<<3>>>  You must not create more than ONE character for your own use  -
   If we discover that you are using more than one character, the additional
   character(s) will be destroyed and the Internet site you connect from
   could receive a ban on creating new characters.

*  <<<3>>>  Do not advertise any other MUD which can be accessed via the
   Internet, on a public channel, via TCZ internal mail or in a title/
   description.  This includes saying the address in a room.  You can give
   out the address of another MUD over a private channel to another user
   (Providing they have asked you for it), e.g:  Via 'page', 'tell' or 'mail'.


Rules for Builders...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As a Builder, the rules for General Users apply as well as the following...

*  Before you can be given building privileges, you must atleast set your
   PRIVATE E-mail address to your REAL E-mail address, by typing '@email
   private <EMAIL ADDRESS>'.  An anonymous or forwarding E-mail address
   can't be accepted.  Your private E-mail address is only visible to yourself
   and the administrators of TCZ, and will be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.

*  As a Builder, you may have upto a maximum of ONE permanent puppet, providing
   you can fully justify the need for it.  Temporary puppets can be obtained
   by Builders for the purpose of testing building work from the point of view
   of another user (Please ask Admin for details of the Puppet Bank.)

*  <<<4>>>  You must not use your building privileges to purposely annoy, spam
   (Send large quanities of output), abuse, harrass, offend or invade the
   privacy of other users.

*  <<<4>>>  You must not use your building privileges to hack or purposely
   'lag' TCZ.

*  <<<5>>>  You must not create compound commands which will inconvenience,
   confuse or attempt to use/obtain the privileges of another user.  This
   includes making compound commands which 'shadow' built-in commands (E.g:
   '@command say;emote;page;tell', etc.)

*  <<<5>>>  You must not use your building privileges to try and obtain
   Apprentice Wizard/Druid or above powers, or compound commands which allow
   you to execute commands under the ID or privileges of another character.


Rules for Assistants and Experienced Builders...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As an Assistant or Experienced Builder, the rules for both General Users and
Builders apply as well as the following...

*  The Assistant and Experienced Builder ranks are NOT part of the
   administration team, and do not have any administrative rights or
   privileges (With the exception of the use of the 'assist' and 'welcome'
   commands when there are few or no Admin connected.)

*  <<<3>>>  As an Assistant, you must be prepared to help any users who ask
   you for it.  If you are unable to help them, you should direct them to
   either a member of Admin or another Assistant/Experienced Builder who can.

*  Providing help and assistance is a requirement of the Assistant rank, but
   optional for Experienced Builders, who are given the rank as recognition
   for their building skills and to help them to improve and extend their
   skills further.  However, Experienced Builders must not outrightly refuse
   to give help and assistance  -  If you do not wish to help the user, you
   must redirect them to another Assistant, Experienced Builder or member of
   Admin who can.

*  <<<3>>>  If there are only a few members of Admin connected, or no Admin
   connected at all, you should use the 'assist' command to check for and
   provide assistance to users who require it, and welcome new users.

*  <<<5>>>  Experienced Builders must not use their extra privileges to hack
   or obtain privileges to which they are not entitled.  Experienced Builder
   privileges are entrusted to the users to whom they are given.  Any abuse
   of these extra privileges will result in removal of Experienced Builder
   status.

*  <<<4>>>  As an Experienced Builder or Assistant, you must behave reasonably
   and responsibly at all times.  This is because you will be looked up to and
   approached for help by both existing and new users.  Although giving help
   and assistance is not a requirement of the Experienced Builder status (It is
   a requirement of the Assistant status, however), you must not outrightly
   refuse or be offensive to the user asking.  If you do not wish to help them
   or are unable to, please refer them to another Assistant, Experienced
   Builder or administrator.

NOTE:  If an Experienced Builder has their HELP flag set, all rules which apply
       to Assistants also apply to them (In addition to Experienced Builder
       rules.)


Rules for Apprentice Wizards/Druids and above...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As an Apprentice Wizard/Druid or above, it's important that you act responsibly
and fairly at all times, and give help and assistance to users as and when they
need it to the best of your ability.  It's important that you bear in mind that
anything you do or say in public reflects not only on yourself, but the entire
Admin team and TCZ as a whole, both of which you are a part of and
representing.

These rules are designed as basic guidelines to what you should and shouldn't
do as an administrator, and must be followed at all times.  Violating the rules
will result in appropriate punishment and official warnings being issued.
Failure to comply with the rules after official warnings have been issued
could ultimately result in your demotion.


General rules for administators...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  <<<5>>>  Do not do anything which could degrade the credibility of TCZ, its
   Admin team, or the provider of its Internet connection.

*  <<<5>>>  Do not harrass any user, or do anything which may cause users to
   leave TCZ, and use another MUD instead.  If there are personal problems with
   a certain user, then avoid contact with them.  If necessary, use the friend
   flags to block all messages from them.  Type 'fadd <NAME>' and 'fset <NAME>
   = enemy !fchat !link !mail !pagetell !pagetellfriends'.

*  <<<4>>>  Do not connect to TCZ if you are depressed, drunk, or otherwise
   likely to act irresponsibly and abuse your powers.

*  <<<3>>>  Do not advertise any other MUD which can be accessed via the
   Internet, on a public channel, via TCZ internal mail or in a title/
   description.  This includes saying the address in a room.  You can give
   out the address of another MUD over a private channel to another user
   (Providing they have asked you for it), e.g:  Via 'page', 'tell' or 'mail'.

*  <<<4>>>  Do not act irresponsibly elsewhere on the Internet, where you can
   be recognised as a member of the TCZ Admin team.  This means do not go to
   other MUD's and be abusive, or advertise TCZ on them.

*  <<<5>>>  Do not 'hack' to obtain privileges higher than your level.  If you
   need a certain privilege, ask someone of a higher level than you to help you
   with it.

*  <<<1>>>  Do not boot a dead connection unless it's absolutely necessary  -
   The '@bootdead' command can be used by a user to boot any dead connections
   they might have.  Connections that are 'stuck' can also be revived by
   logging in again and taking them over.

*  <<<1>>>  Mortal users are only allowed a maximum of ONE puppet, providing
   the need for it can be fully justified.  Temporary puppets can be obtained
   by Mortals from the Puppet Bank (This can be reached by typing 'puppet'.)
   The use of a permanent puppet in a building project as a shopkeeper (For
   example) is not a suitable use.  A suitably named object would give the
   desired effect.


Rules for dealing with other users....
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  <<<4>>>  Answer all assists and welcomes when you can, especially if there
   are few Admin connected, or you are the only member of Admin connected.  If
   there is a sufficient number of Admin connected, try to take it in turns to
   do them.  New Admin have priority over assists and welcomes.  Remember that
   higher ranking members of Admin may not see assist/welcome messages if a
   sufficient number of lower ranking Admin are connected.

*  <<<4>>>  If a user asks you for help, help them to the best of your ability
   -  This is a priority over building or chatting to your friends.  If you are
   not able to help them, ask someone who can.  It's important to stay and see
   what the answer to the problem is, and to try and learn from it.  If no
   other administrators are available to help, then TCZ mail someone who you
   know is able to solve the problem, or direct them to an Experienced Builder
   (If one is connected.)

*  <<<4>>>  Do not summon users or teleport them around against their will.

*  <<<2>>>  Feel free to teleport to other users locations to examine them and
   their contents, but if the owner or other characters are connected and in
   the location, then ask permission to visit first.

*  <<<3>>>  If you find a room or thing that acts as a jail (Holds you there),
   ask the user to remove it or disable it.  If they do not comply, use an
   appropriate punishment.  If all else fails, remove their BUILDER flag.
   (If you find yourself stuck in a jail, use the 'escape' command to get out.)


Rules for dealing with abusive/problem users...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  <<<4>>>  If a user is abusive to you or other users  -  Deal with them
   appropriately.  The order of punishment is as follows:

   An official warning:  'warn <NAME> = <REASON>'. 
                         Official warnings are logged to the 'Warn' log file.
   
   The Punishment Zone:  'punish <NAME> = <REASON>'.
                         They will be broken off from all contact with other
                         users, and have to type out some of TCZ's rules,
                         before getting out.  (Use 'unpunish <NAME> = <REASON>'
                         to let them out prematurely.)

   Jail:                 'jail <NAME> = <REASON>'. 
                         They will be unable to leave the jail.  Admin can get
                         out by typing 'door' or 'escape'.  (Use 'free <NAME>
                         = <REASON>' to let them out.)

   Moron:                '@set *<NAME> = moron = <REASON>'. 
                         They will then have negative privileges.  They will be
                         unable to page people (Except Admin), use TCZ mail, or
                         whisper secretly.  (Use '@set *<NAME> = !moron =
                         <REASON>' to reset the moron flag.)

   Boot:                 '@boot *<NAME> = <REASON> [= <BAN TIME>]'. 
                         They will be booted (Forcefully disconnected) from
                         TCZ, and a public message will be displayed showing
                         the boot and the reason.  It's also logged to the
                         'Boot' log file.  <BAN TIME> is an optional time in
                         minutes (Upto 60 minutes) to ban the user, so that
                         they can't reconnect again almost immediately.

   Ban:                  '@ban *<NAME> = <TIME>|permanently = <REASON>'. 
                         Bans the user for the time specified or permanently.
                         Users can only be banned by Wizard/Druids and above.
                         If you're an Apprentice Wizard/Druid and can't set a
                         necessary ban, ask a higher level character to do so
                         for you.  (Use '@ban *<NAME> = lift = <REASON>' to
                         lift a ban.)  Be sure to send E-mail to the banned
                         user explaining why they have been banned.

*  Site bans  -  <<<3>>>  If a user keeps creating new duplicate characters
                 and/or Guest characters, then a site ban may be necessary.

                 *  To ban a site from creating characters, use:
                    '@site set <ADDRESS> = !create = <REASON>'.
                 *  Likewise, to stop Guest character being created from a
                    site, use:
                    '@site set <ADDRESS> = !guest = <REASON>'.
                 *  The flags can be combined:
                    '@site set <ADDRESS> = !create !guest = <REASON>'.

                 If you set a site to be create or guest banned, you should
                 re-describe it to reflect that  -  Use '@site desc
                 <IP ADDRESS> = <DESCRIPTION>'.  Add '(Create Banned)',
                 '(Guest Banned)', or '(Create and Guest Banned)' to the end
                 of the site's description.

*  Mail abuse  -  <<<4>>>  If a user is abusing the internal mail system, reset
                  their MAIL flag using '@set *<NAME> = !mail = <REASON>'.
                  This prevents them from sending or receiving any mail
                  whatsoever.  If they're just harrasing one particular user,
                  get that user to add them as a friend (Or enemy), and type
                  'fset <NAME> = !mail'.  This prevents them sending mail to
                  that one person.

*  BBS abuse   -  <<<4>>>  If someone continually abuses the BBS by posting
                  rude, offensive or degrading messages, then reset their BBS
                  flag using '@set *<NAME> = !bbs = <REASON>'.

*  Rap sheets  -  <<<2>>>  Log any abuse onto a user's rapsheet with the
                  'addrap' command.  The usage is 'addrap <NAME> = <ABUSE>'.
                  To see what they've done in the past, use 'checkrap <NAME>'.
                  This helps to identify consistent problem users.

*  Monitoring users  -  <<<4>>>  If a user is suspected of hacking or abuse,
                        and needs to be watched, use the '@monitor' command.
                        The basic use is '@monitor <NAME> = commands =
                        <REASON>'.  Do not use '@monitor' unless it's strictly
                        necessary, as it breaches on the user's privacy.  Use
                        '@monitor <NAME> = off' to stop monitoring. 


Rules for administrative privileges...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  <<<1>>>  Use the 'shout' command only for important messages which ALL users
   connected need to see.  '@with connected ...' in conjunction with 'page',
   'tell' or '@notify' is treated as a 'shout'.  Please remember that you are
   representing the Admin team as a whole, and every connected user will see
   your message.

*  <<<1>>>  Do not use 'page', 'tell' or '@notify' in conjunction with '@with
   friends' or '@with connected' as an alternative or substitute for the 'page
   friends', 'tell friends' or 'shout' command.  This rule is for two simple
   reasons...

   (1)  It causes extra and unnecessary work for the server, especially if
        you have a large friends list or there are a good number of users
        connected.  'page friends', 'tell friends' or 'shout' will only take
        a few milliseconds to execute, whereas '@with friends' or '@with
        connected' can take upto several seconds, causing unnecessary 'lag'.

   (2)  If '@notify' is used with these commands, the recipients have no easy
        means of selectively blocking the messages if they do not wish to
        receive them.  With 'page friends' and 'tell friends' they can simply
        reset the PAGETELLFRIENDS friend flag on you if they do not wish to
        receive the messages.  If 'page'/'tell' is used (I.e:  '@with friends
        me do tell $6 = hello'), this can be extremely confusing for the
        recipients, as to them it appears as though you have specifically and
        individually sent the message to them, rather than your entire list
        of friends.

*  <<<5>>>  Do not give out your privileges to other characters, by giving out
   your password or giving them a compound command with your '@chpid' in it.

*  <<<4>>>  Do not use your privileges for your own personal gain, benefit or
   pleasure.

*  <<<4>>>  Do not use '@force' to force another character (Excluding your own
   puppets) to execute a command or say something against their will.

*  <<<4>>>  Do not use fuses to monitor rooms or characters.  This is a serious
   breach of privacy.

*  <<<1>>>  Do not destroy a character on user request under any circumstances.
   If a character is left unused they will eventually be destroyed by the
   automatic maintainence system. 

*  <<<1>>>  Do destroy characters when they are found to be duplicates, but
   only if you are certain that they're duplicates.  Remember that some users
   will connect from the same account and might have the same E-mail address.

*  <<<1>>>  Be very judicious in creating alarms, for your own or any other
   character's use.  Several alarms going off at the same time, or on a
   regular basis (I.e:  More than once every 5 minutes) can cause unnecessary
   'lag'.  The same effect can often be achieved using a fuse and the
   '{@?time}' query command, and should always be done as an alternative,
   if possible.

   The ownership of an alarm should never be changed to a Mortal character.

*  <<<3>>>  Do not use the '@areawrite', '@oecho' or '@write' commands in #2,
   #4, or a public area.  Likewise do not use these (And similar) commands
   (I.e:  '@notify') to fake messages, or fake another user's actions or
   speech.

*  <<<1>>>  When adding Internet sites, use the rules for site adding as stated
   in the APPRENTICES topic on The Chatting Zone BBS or in the file
   'tczadmin.siteguidelines.txt', available from the FTP archive.

*  <<<3>>>  Do not set an execution time limit greater than 3 seconds, unless
   it's absolutely necessary for the compound command to function.  In most
   cases (If not all), it will usually be possible to re-write the compound
   command more efficiently, so that it doesn't need an execution time limit
   greater than 3 seconds.  An execution time limit greater than 5 seconds
   should never be used, as this will cause noticable lag.

*  <<<1>>>  Do not teleport a Mortal owned command to a module in #4 (Or to #4
   itself), if it's not set READONLY.  If the READONLY flag stops the compound
   command working correctly, then it either needs to be re-written or Admin
   owned instead (A Mortal's compound command should never be changed to Admin
   ownership without first extensive checking for hacks, 'backdoors' or flaws
   which could be taken advantage of by Mortals.)

   An easy way to teleport commands into #4 is to use the 'telglobal' command,
   which takes those rules into account.  Type 'telglobal <COMMAND>' to use it.
   The 'checkmodule' command can be used to examine the modules in #4 for 
   any commands which breach the rules.  Any global commands also need to be
   coded efficiently, and use good grammar, spelling, and presentation.

*  <<<5>>>  Do not disclose any information which is only readable/accessible
   by Admin to non-Admin users.  This includes the 'natter' channel, restricted
   BBS topics (Such as the Admin only topics), contents of log files, rap
   sheets, and any other information/commands which a lower level user couldn't
   access themselves.

*  <<<4>>>  Do not destroy or modify objects which belong to other users (Both
   Mortal and Admin owned), unless you have the permission from the owner to
   do so (An exeception to this rule is if the object is being used to 'spam'
   users/areas, is abusive/offensive in some way, or is being used to
   lag/hack TCZ.)

*  <<<3>>>  Do not adjust the bank account or credit in pocket of a user
   without good reason (I.e:  The user has obtained credit by unfair means
   or is in severe debt.)  This is important, because improper use of the
   '@credit' command (I.e:  Injecting excessive money into the system or
   taking it out) could ruin the entire monetry system and make it worthless.


Rules for building and Building Quota limits...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  <<<1>>>  To obtain a BUILDER flag, a character must have a valid and unique
   E-mail address.  This ensures that they are not duplicates.  To see if
   anyone else on TCZ has the same E-mail address, use the 'checkb' command.
   If so, enquire as to why their address is not unique.  To see if the address
   is valid and not fake, the easiest way is to send an E-mail to it, and get
   them to reply.  Do not set a BUILDER flag until you are sure that the
   E-mail address is valid and the character isn't a duplicate.

*  <<<2>>>  Do not raise a characters Building Quota limit above 200, unless
   they really need it, and they are building something of good quality that
   is beneficial to users of TCZ other than themselves and just a few friends.
   This is IMPORTANT  -  'Good quality' means good, well written descriptions,
   fields of exits are set ('@osucc', '@odrop' and '@drop'), compound commands
   are well used and written, no objects are used that could be placed in a
   description instead.  Be very stringent about giving out Building Quota
   limits greater than 200.  It's irrelevant that many other users may already
   have more than 200  -  That's the limit for Builders unless they are
   building something exceptional.


Rules for promotions and demotions...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  <<<5>>>  Do not promote a character to Assistant, Experienced Builder or
   Apprentice Wizard/Druid or higher.  Promotions are carried out when there
   is an Admin review (Or for Experienced Builders and Assistants, as the
   result of a vote in favour between all administrators on The Chatting Zone
   BBS.)  The exception to this is promoting your puppet to Experienced Builder
   or Apprentice Wizard/Druid, if you are able.  If you're an Apprentice
   Wizard/Druid yourself, you can still have your puppet promoted to the same
   level  -  Just ask someone of a higher level to do it for you.

   Assistants and Experienced Builders may be promoted after a votable message
   on The Chatting Zone BBS gives them a 60% or more majority in favour.  The
   message must be on the BBS for at least a week before a promotion is given,
   and the voting must use the majority factor ('vote <NUMBER> = majority'.)

*  <<<4>>>  Only users who are of 16 years of age or over may be promoted to
   the rank of Apprentice Wizard/Druid or above.  This is because material
   Admin may be subject to and situations they may need to deal with are
   unsuitable for users below this age.  If a member of Admin is discovered
   at a later date to be under the age of 16, they will be immediately demoted.

*  <<<4>>>  Administrators on TCZ may not be administrators on any other MUD.
   The main reason for this rule is that someone who is Admin on more than one
   MUD will not be able to be fully dedicated to administrating TCZ, to which
   they should be fully dedicated.  It's also unfair on other people who are
   not administrators on any MUD, who's chances are reduced by people who are
   administrators on more than one MUD.

*  <<<4>>>  Administrators must be able to connect on a regular basis, as one
   of their primary tasks is giving help and assistance to both existing and
   new users and dealing with abusive/problem users.  Of course, allowances
   are made for holidays and other periods where a member of Admin will be
   away for a short period of time.  If you are going to be away for a period
   of time, you must announce when and how long you will be away in the
   ADMIN/ABSENCES topic of The Chatting Zone BBS.  If you fail to do this,
   your demotion may occur.

   A member of Admin should ideally connect for 24 hours or more each month.
   If a member's connect time is considered insufficient in a period of 3
   consecutive months, their status will be subject to review.

*  <<<2>>>  If a member of Admin wishes to resign, then demote them, but be
   sure to remind them that they have a period of 2 weeks in which to change
   their mind.  After this period has passed, they will need to go through the
   review process again to re-join the Admin team.  If an Experienced Builder
   or Builder abuses their building privileges, take their flag away.  If you
   are not sure about doing this, discuss it on '@nat' and have a vote if
   necessary.

*  <<<4>>>  The returning of a flag (Experienced Builder/Assistant and above)
   should first go to an Admin vote, unless predefined by a time period
   elapsing (I.e:  Their flag was taken away for one week and one week
   has elapsed since its removal.)  The vote should be held in the BBS
   'Admin/Voting' topic, where ALL Admin may vote.

*  <<<5>>>  If a member of Admin starts maliciously abusing their power/
   privileges, and refuses to stop, everything within the power of the
   administrators connected at the time should be done to stop them,
   including demotion, if necessary.


Administrator duties in general (For ALL administration levels)...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  Welcoming new users to The Chatting Zone ('welcome [<NAME>]'.)

*  Giving help and assistance to users who ask for it ('assist [<NAME>]'.)

*  Dealing with requests for new characters ('@request'.)

*  Dealing with duplicate and ASHCAN'ed characters ('@destroy *<NAME> = yes =
   <REASON>'.)

*  Dealing with users using the 'gripe' or 'emergency' commands, if you are
   able to.

*  Making sure titles are not abusive or offensive (These can be reset with
   '@title *<NAME>', if the character refuses to change it, when asked.)

*  Punishing abusive/problem users and hackers (See the Official Rules for
   details of the punishments which should be issued, and the order in which
   they are issued.)

*  Setting name prefixes ('@prefix <NAME> = <NAME PREFIX>') and name suffixes
   ('@suffix <NAME> = <NAME SUFFIX>'.)  Please make sure they are not abusive,
   offensive or use censored words.

*  Changing a forgotten password for a character ('@newpassword <NAME> =
   <NEW PASSWORD>')  -  Please ensure that they are authentic, and not
   somebody else, trying to hack into another person's character.  (One way
   to do this is to check their E-mail address, and send their new password
   to the E-mail address they have set on TCZ.)

*  Setting BUILDER flags ('@set *<NAME> = builder'), after checking that the
   potential Builder has set their E-Mail address, and is not a duplicate
   character (Use 'checkb <NAME>' to check.)

*  Teleporting Builders' Top Areas to 'The Top Area For Builders(#646)'
   ('@tel #<ID> = #646' or 'toptel #<ID>'.)

*  Assessing Building Quota rises for Builders ('@quotalimit'), having checked
   the quality of what they have built so far.  Please see following section
   on 'Building Quota' for further details regarding Building Quota increases.

*  Setting Experienced Builder ('@set *<NAME> = experienced') or Assistant
   ('@set *<NAME> = assistant') flags on users, as a result of a vote in
   favour on The Chatting Zone BBS between all administrators of TCZ.

*  Adding and checking Internet site descriptions ('@site add <ADDRESS> [=]
   <DESCRIPTION>' and '@site desc <ADDRESS> [=] <DESCRIPTION>'  -  You may
   also wish to investigate the use of the 'sitereport' commands for this
   purpose.
