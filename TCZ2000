The TCZ 2000 Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Chatting Zone (Or TCZ for short) is a sophisticated Interactive
Multi-user Environment, designed for use over the Internet for social
(Chat) and gaming (Adventure) purposes.

It has a wide variety of features, including integration with the
World Wide Web (WWW), and the ability for users to construct and
expand the virtual world (Database) from within, without the need
for programming skills or advanced computer knowledge.

The TCZ 2000 Project was setup on 11/04/1999 and was aimed at pratically
continuing the development of TCZ for the millenium and beyond.

Due to lack of time, work on this project ceased.  To allow continued
development, TCZ has now been setup as a proper SourceForge project
which can be found at:  http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tcz


History
~~~~~~~
TCZ is orginally based on a heavily modified combination of early
TinyMUD & UglyMUG code-bases.  Development began in late 1993 by
J.P.Boggis (Aka JC Digita) with the first public running version
appearing about a year later (28/11/1994), following a number of
successful test runs.

The source code was kept closed between 1993 - 2004, and was
maintained/developed by a sole coder (J.P.Boggis) who had complete
control over the direction, development and progress of the code.
During this time, the source code was never officially
publicly distributed.

Development was rapid during the period of 1993 - 1997, when the
coder (J.P.Boggis) had a large amount of time to dedicate to TCZ
and its development.  However, after entering full-time employment
in 1997, development rapidly slowed down due to the inavailability
of free time and the amount of work which required doing.

As a result, the TCZ 2000 project was conceived to place TCZ's code
and development into the public domain, to ensure its future,
continued interest and development.

TCZ's code is now publicly available under the GPL (GNU General
Public License - See http://www.gnu.org) and can be obtained from:

   http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/tcz

TCZ Project Aims
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  To develop and maintain the TCZ source code:

   *  Manage and maintain the TCZ CVS repository at SourceForge.

   *  Co-ordinate all work on the source code.

   *  Decide on suitability of new features for inclusion and who
      should work on implementing them.

   *  Prevent two or more people working independantly on the same or
      similar coding project.

   *  Ensure new features are consistent with the rest of the TCZ
      code-base:

      *  Proper layout and comments documenting the source code.
      *  British English language (By default if multiple languages
         are supported in the future.)
      *  Correct spelling, punctuation and grammar.
      *  Correct colour schemes and formatting.
      *  Good, clear layout/formatting of any produced output.
      *  Clear and concise help for TCZ Manual(s) & On-line Help.
      *  Easy to understand tutorials where appropriate.
      *  User-friendliness and ease of use.
      *  Fully expandible for future additions/modifications.
      *  Backwardly compatibility with earlier databases, commands, etc.
      *  Consistency with other TCZ features.

   *  Maintain accurate and detailed log of all changes made to the
      source code, along with the date and who they were made by.

   *  Ensure code is fully beta-tested and is reliable before it is put
      into general use at sites running TCZ-based code.

   *  Code updates occur on a regular basis (But not without thorough
      testing prior to release), and sites running TCZ-based code are
      made aware of availability of new, stable code so that they can
      upgrade.

*  To maintain up-to-date lists of the following:

   *  Sites running TCZ code.

   *  People working on or contributing to the TCZ, their role (Coder, tester,
      etc.) and what they are currently working on.

   *  Suggestions made by TCZ users for improvement, new features,
      modification, etc.

   *  New features to be implemented.

   *  Bugs, hacks & security flaws which need fixing.

   *  Improvements/optimisations to be made.

   *  Assignment of the above to coders, testers and debuggers.

   *  List of all changes made to the source code (Date, source file(s),
      who made change and details of what has been changed.)

*  Maintain central web site for the TCZ project and all resources
   related to it:

   *  Information about TCZ.

   *  List of sites running TCZ (For proper use or development/
      testing.)

   *  Downloads of source code (Current, beta and older), compiled
      binaries for popular OS's and other TCZ related resources.

   *  Forums for TCZ users (And anybody else) to make suggestions for
      improvement, new features, modifications, etc.

   *  Questions/answers forum for the project (To allow questions to
      be asked about TCZ source code, TCZ in general, 'soft' coding,
      etc.

   *  Mailing lists for:

      *  People interested in the project.
      *  Making suggestions/conveying ideas.
      *  Discussing issues related to the project.
      *  Coders, testers & debuggers.
      *  Sites running TCZ code.

   *  Ensure all information on the web site is kept up-to-date.

*  People to manage the code-base.
*  People to manage TCZ project web site.
*  Coders to implement new features.
*  Coders to improve and optimise existing code.
*  Testers to test existing, new & modified code for bugs, hacks &
   security flaws.
*  Coders to debug code to resolve bugs, hacks & security flaws.

Some ideas for major improvements to TCZ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*  Fully featured, built-in mail system (Currently exists as unfinished
   BETA code), with support for mailing groups of people, subjects on
   messages, stopping accidentally sent mail, auto-deletion of older
   messages, etc.  Could also possibly allow sending and even receiving
   small text-only Internet mails (Sending could be risky (Abuse),
   although a full log of sent mails (Who sent them, subject and where
   sent to) could be kept.)  Log of received mails (Who from, subject
   and who to) could also be kept.  Users could be banned from sending
   and receiving internal and/or external mail.  Would also need
   anti-spam/mail-bomb features (Both sending and reception of mail.)

*  Fully featured channel communication system (Currently exists as
   unfinished BETA code), with named channels, member lists, ability
   to ban users, etc.

*  Improvements to the WWW Interface, making it fully compatible with
   different browsers and implementing newer HTML features not
   currently taken advantage of (I.e:  JAVA, style-sheets, etc.)

*  User-friendly graphical JAVA interfaces for building, BBS, mail
   (When implemented), character (Scan, profile, etc.), friends list,
   etc.  For example, building interface would feature 'tree' style
   list of objects you have access to, hierachically organised.
   Each object type can be edited using its own JAVA-based editor
   allowing descriptions, flags, etc. to be set easily.  Error
   messages being displayed in dialogue boxes.

*  Improvements to building language, with new building/coding
   commands, delayed execution, timed execution (Replacing alarms),
   ability to stop delayed/timed executed commands, delayed/timed
   usable by Builders (Restraints to ensure they can't be abused
   either accidentally or on purpose), and even possibly some sort
   of multi-tasking to replace the present sequential execution of
   compound commands.

*  Ability to import/export objects in an independant manner (XML),
   for backup, off-line editing, importing into another TCZ (Such
   as a personal one running locally on user's computer), etc.  A
   tool for off-line editing without running a TCZ server could be
   developed, or better still, the JAVA interface for building could
   work offline with import/export files, as well as on-line,
   connected up to a TCZ-based server.  Import/export could work
   using cut/paste (On user input/output), HTML upload/download,
   E-mail (Possibility), FTP (Possibility) and files on hard disk
   of server machine (Only practical for site Admin.)

*  Port of TCZ to other Operating Systems, such as Win95/98/NT for
   personal running (Has already been achieved using CygWin32, but
   it would be nicer if it could run without any 3rd party software.)
   Porting to other UNIX O/S's, such as BSD, SunOS (May be easy, as
   early TCZ's were developed under SunOS), etc.

*  Ability to change the names of different Admin ranks, etc. on TCZ,
   and full support in all commands within TCZ, plus substitutions to
   allow currect rank names to be easily inserted (Automatically) into
   On-line Help, soft-coded compound commands, etc.

*  Secure sockets (SSL) support for SSH and https:// connections to
   TCZ, preventing packet snooping on conversations, passwords, etc.
   Also, implemented into InterTCZ so that communication between
   TCZ -> local InterTCZ server -> remote InterTCZ servers is
   encrypted and secure.

*  Communications between TCZ servers (InterTCZ), with compatibility
   with InterMUD.  Would allow the following and more:

   *  Separate InterTCZ server that communicates directly with TCZ
      and remote InterTCZ servers (Preferably using secure sockets
      (SSL)).

   *  'info' facility, to show details of remote TCZ, such as name,
      description (I.e:  Theme, etc.), Telnet/HTML address, web site,
      Admin. E-mail, etc.  USAGE:  'info tczservername'.

   *  'ping' facility, to determine if remote server is up or down.
       USAGE:  'ping tczservername'

   *  'verify' facility to verify existence of user on remote server
      and their various preferences (Screen size, Telnet/HTML, etc.)
      USAGE:  'verify name@tczservername'.

   *  'globalwho' ('gwho') - To show user list of everyone connected
      to a TCZ-based server, with login time, idle time and TCZ server
      name.

   *  Ability to view various user lists ('who', 'swho', etc.)
      (InterMUD:  'who' only.)  USAGE:  'who@tczservername'.

   *  Pages/tells to/from remote users (InterMUD:  'page' converted
      to 'tell'.)  USAGE:  'page name@tczservername'.

   *  Mail to/from remote users.  USAGE:  'mail name@tczservername'.

   *  Ability to view scan and profile of users (InterTCZ only), i.e:
      'scan name@tczservername'.

   *  Remote BBS topics/sub-topics (I.e:  Topic hosted on one TCZ
      server, other TCZ servers can link topics in their BBS's up
      to it.)  (InterTCZ only.)

   *  Ability to join channels on remote TCZ's (When implemented.)
      Also, ability to have channels shared between TCZ's, with
      messages relayed between the servers (I.e:  A TCZ channel
      on each TCZ, all linked together, so user joins the channel
      on the local TCZ, but messages are relayed/received to/from
      the remote TCZ's.)

   *  Ability to restrict access for local users to InterTCZ and
      InterMUD (I.e:  If they are abusing it.)  Particular services
      can be restricted, or all access can be barred.

   *  Ability to restrict access for remote users (I.e:  Stop
      somebody at a remote server from sending mail to users at the
      local TCZ.)

   *  Ability to control InterTCZ and InterMUD communications at
      server level (I.e:  Which remote TCZ's/other InterMUD MUD's
      have access to which services.)  Default can be set (For
      unlisted/new servers), and ability to set for individually
      named servers (I.e:  You can set default not to allow mail
      from remote servers.  Those which can send mail would have
      their own entry which allows mail.)

   *  Security, to prevent anybody from just starting up a TCZ-based
      server and using it to abuse InterTCZ.  For example, each TCZ
      requires a code to communicate with each other TCZ, co-ordinated
      by the TCZ project.  Each server authorised to use the system
      (Would need to be a permanent server), would receive a list of
      codes/certificates on a regular basis to allow communication
      with other TCZ's on the system.  The list would be unique for
      each TCZ server.  Servers that do not have authorisation could
      still use InterTCZ in a restricted fashion (I.e:  No remote
      page/tell, mail, etc., but 'safe' commands like remote 'who',
      'globalwho', etc. would still work.)

   *  Ability to export/import objects between TCZ's over the InterTCZ
      system.

   *  Possibility of reference objects that reference an object on a
      remote TCZ, so it appears as though it is part of the local one.
      And possibly exits that link to rooms on a remote TCZ.  Reference
      objects could also reference objects on local TCZ too.

   *  Ability to remote login to other TCZ's, and control the
      connection from the local one (Via InterTCZ.)  I.e:  Execute
      commands using 'command@tczservername', i.e:  'say@othertcz
      "Hello!"'.  User list of remote TCZ would show that user was
      remotely connected, i.e:  'NAME is remotely connected from
      TCZServerName'.

   *  Site DNS name lookup for lag free lookup.

   *  Remote centralised TCZ site database with effecient lookup by
      IP and centralised ban options for problem sites (Which 
      individual TCZ servers can choose to utilise and optionally
      override with their own local site database.)  Administration
      of this central site database would be of course done and
      controlled by the TCZ project.  TCZ sites could submit new
      sites and corrections to the database to make it the
      most accurate and comprehensive database available.

   *  Within InterTCZ, usernames are transmitted with realname,
      #ID and TCZ server InterTCZ name for full identification,
      allowing barring, access control, etc. (#ID number used for this
      purpose, as it doesn't change.)  Validity of #ID's is checked
      rotationally, using identification facility of InterTCZ.  User
      parameters, such as screen width/height, Telnet/HTML, ANSI colour
      preference, etc. would be transmitted to allow correct formatting
      (I.e:  So user lists can be made to fit the screen of the remote
      user, etc., taking advantage of extra large screens.)

      Example:  Fred.Bloggs@SomeTCZ|#12345|80x24,T16

      (Space in realname replaced with '.', TCZ server InterTCZ name,
      #ID of remote user (For validation), 80x24 screen, Telnet with
      16 colour ANSI.)  Preferences can be omitted for remote
      commands which do not need this info (I.e:  Sending mail.)
